## 🌏 Overview

Based on the AI capabilities of GPT4 powered by the Azure Engine and our Expertise as your existing MSFT + LinkedIn Partner for GHD, I'd love to explore the economic & Global implications AI capabilities have. Based on the latest economist article [see link], and GHD's passion for environmental impact and enabling sustainability. We are very interested in MSFT utilizing this AI within the current suite of GHD suite of purchased product [i.e subsidiary LinkedIn to attract GHD future employees and retain our current employees]. What is in the roadmap tying AI and the positive environmental impacts it can have. Per economist article in the latest edition - their Editor's take is that environmental global crisis is a direct line to geopolitical conflicts. Just a humble partner looking for you to solve world peace Sincerely, Not Greta Thunberg haha
