## 🗓️ Day 16 of #30DaysOfAzureAI

<!-- Short description section -->

**Train and Deploy ML Models at Scale**

<!-- Intro section -->

Last week was for Azure AI App developers. This week, we switch gears and focus on Azure Machine Learning services for people building, deploying, and "productionalizing" ML models. If you're a Data Scientist, or an ML or MLOps engineer, then this week is for you. 

Today, learn about training and deploying machine learning models using Azure ML.

## 🎯 What we'll cover

<!-- What we'll cover section -->


- How to train and deploy a machine learning model using Azure ML
- The three most common methods of creating resources: Azure ML CLI, Python SDK, and Studio UI

## 🚌 How to train and deploy in Azure ML

Read [today's article](https://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/aml-command) is perfect if you have a basic understanding of how to train a machine learning model, but you've never used Azure ML before, then you're in the right place. [Today's article](https://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/aml-command) is a hands-on introduction to the most fundamental operations of Azure ML: training and deploying a machine learning model in the cloud. It discusses which resources you need to create, and the three main methods of creating them: the Azure ML CLI, the Python SDK, and the Studio UI.

The goal for today is for you to have a deep technical understanding of the basics of Azure ML. The article demonstrates how to train and deploy a simple model, but you'll be able to apply the same concepts to your own ML projects, regardless of their complexity.ß
