## 🚌 Get started with Machine Learning for Beginners

[Today's article](https://microsoft.github.io/ML-For-Beginners/) is about the Microsoft Machine Learning for Beginners curriculum, a free 12-week, 26-lesson curriculum all about Machine Learning. 

In this curriculum, you will learn about what is sometimes called classic machine learning, using primarily Scikit-learn as a library and avoiding deep learning, which is covered in the [Artificial Intelligence for Beginners](https://microsoft.github.io/AI-For-Beginners/) curriculum. Pair these lessons with our [Data Science for Beginners](https://microsoft.github.io/ML-For-Beginners/) curriculum, as well!

What are you waiting for? Get started today!
