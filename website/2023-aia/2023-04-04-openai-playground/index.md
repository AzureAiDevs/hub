## 🚌 Getting started with the Azure OpenAI Playground

Read [today's article](https://medium.com/microsoftazure/azure-openai-playground-279f1f3da562) to gain an overview of language models and hyperparameters, with a focus on conversational AI models from OpenAI, and how to use the Azure OpenAI Service Playground to experiment with these models.

Learn about the three main categories of models offered by OpenAI: GPT-3, Codex, and Embeddings, and the different models available within each category. You'll learn how to tune hyperparameters to tailor the models to specific use cases, and how to consume the models using OpenAI's APIs.
