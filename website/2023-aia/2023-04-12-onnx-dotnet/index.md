## 🗓️ Day 11 of #30DaysOfAzureAI

<!-- README
The following description is also used for the tweet. So it should be action oriented and grab attention 
If you update the description, please update the description: in the frontmatter as well.

**Building Cross-Platform AI Solutions with ONNX and .NET**

<!-- README
The following is the intro to the post. It should be a short teaser for the post.
-->

Yesterday was all about the power of OpenAI to create intelligent dynamic apps. Today is for people looking to build cross-platform intelligent apps with .NET MAUI and ONNX.

## 🎯 What we'll cover

<!-- README
The following list is the main points of the post. There should be 3-4 main points.
 -->


- Machine learning models with ONNX and .NET.
- AI, machine learning, expert systems, and deep learning, and how they relate to traditional programming.

<!-- 
- Main point 1
- Main point 2
- Main point 3 
- Main point 4
-->

## 🚌 Build cross-platform intelligent apps with ONNX and .NET

Watch [today's video](https://youtu.be/h6HWP5jpA5s) about machine learning models using ONNX and .NET. The presenters, Bea and Henk, start with an overview of AI and machine learning, explaining that machine learning is a subset of AI that involves creating a model that can learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. They discuss deep learning, a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural network and is well-suited to big data.
