## 🗓️ Day 11 of #30DaysOfAzureAI

<!-- Short description section -->

**Building Cross-Platform AI Solutions with ONNX and .NET**

<!-- Intro section -->

Yesterday was all about the power of OpenAI to create intelligent dynamic apps. Today is for people looking to build cross-platform intelligent apps with .NET MAUI and the ONNX Runtime.

## 🎯 What we'll cover

<!-- What we'll cover section -->


- Build intelligent apps with ONNX and .NET. 
- How AI is related to traditional programming.

## 🚌 Build cross-platform intelligent apps with ONNX and .NET

Watch [today's video](https://youtu.be/h6HWP5jpA5s) about machine learning models using ONNX and .NET. The presenters, Bea and Henk, start with an overview of AI and machine learning, explaining that machine learning is a subset of AI that involves creating a model that can learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. They discuss deep learning, a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural network and is well-suited to big data.
