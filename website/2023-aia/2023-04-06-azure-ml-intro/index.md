## 🚌 Introduction to Azure ML

Read [today's article](https://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/aml-introduction/) to understand the benefits of using cloud computing for machine learning projects, and to get an overview of Microsoft's Azure ML platform. Azure ML enables you to train and deploy machine learning models in the cloud, by creating a variety of resources that help tailor the workflow to your needs. Today's article provides an overview of each of those resources, and explains the four different ways of creating them.

The goal for today is for you to get a foundational understanding of Azure ML concepts, so that you'll be able to follow code samples later in the AI April month.
