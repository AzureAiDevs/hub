## 🚌 Introducing the Azure AI Hub

Read [today's article](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-ai) to learn about the Azure AI Hub repository, a curated list of samples for AI app developers looking to use Azure AI services for common end-to-end scenarios. 

The repo includes sample code in different programming languages, as well as a forum for developers to communicate directly with Microsoft product teams and other developers using Azure AI. The sample code covers topics like OpenAI, Speech, Language, Applied AI/Decision, and more. The platform welcomes contributions, feedback, and suggestions from the developer community.
