**How to run Stable Diffusion Web UI on Azure ML compute instances**

<!-- README
The following is the intro to the post. It should be a short teaser for the post.
-->

Yesterday we learned about how to build a Patient Registration app with Azure Form Recognizer. Today's your opportunity to be "wowed" by the power of image generative models and run Stable Diffusion on Azure ML. Let's go!

## 🎯 What we'll cover

<!-- README
The following list is the main points of the post. There should be 3-4 main points.
 -->


- The Azure ML resources necessary for running Stable Diffusion.
- Installing and configuring Stable Diffusion Web UI on Azure ML GPU Compute Instances.
- Tips and tricks for improving the performance and security of your installation.

<!-- 
- Main point 1
- Main point 2
- Main point 3 
- Main point 4

## 🚌 Get creative with Stable Diffusion on Azure ML

[Today's article](https://vladiliescu.net/stable-diffusion-web-ui-on-azure-ml/) takes you into the fascinating world of Stable Diffusion's image generative model - a model that can generate images of faces, animals, anything really. It's a lot of fun to play with, so let your imagination run wild.

You'll learn about the prerequisites required to run Stable Diffusion Web UI in Azure ML, and get access to custom code snippets that will help you get started. You'll also find out how to configure the Web UI to run on a GPU compute instance, and how to optimize your installation for prolonged usage.

## Watch the Stable Diffusion session on the AI Show
