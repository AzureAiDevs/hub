## 🗓️ Day 20 of #30DaysOfAzureAI

<!-- README
The following description is also used for the tweet. So it should be action oriented and grab attention 
If you update the description, please update the description: in the frontmatter as well.
-->

**Learn about Azure Machine Learning lifecycle and open source tooling to start building MLOps**

<!-- README
The following is the intro to the post. It should be a short teaser for the post.
-->

Yesterday we learned about the Azure ML Responsible AI Dashboard. Today is an introduction to Azure MLOps, where you'll learn how to "productionalize" ML models with Azure ML.

## 🎯 What we'll cover

<!-- README
The following list is the main points of the post. There should be 3-4 main points.
 -->


- Azure ML MLOps
- Practices and tools for managing the machine learning lifecycle.
- Improving data scientists and developer collaboration.

<!-- 
- Main point 1
- Main point 2
- Main point 3 
- Main point 4
-->

## 🚌 Learn Live MLOps to streamline the ML Lifecycle

[Watch today's video](https://learn.microsoft.com/events/ignite-2022/cll99-learn-live-start-machine-learning-lifecycle-with-mlops?WT.mc_id=aiml-89446-dglover) about MLOps for the ML Lifecycle. The presenters, Cassie and Korey, start with an overview of MLOps, explaining that it is a set of practices and tools that help data scientists and developers work together to build and deploy machine learning models.

Cassie and Korey discuss the benefits of MLOps, including faster time to value, improved collaboration, and increased model quality. They also discuss the challenges of MLOps, including the need for a common language, the need for a common platform, and the need for a common process.
