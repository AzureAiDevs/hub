## 🗓️ Day 12 of #30DaysOfAzureAI

<!-- README
The following description is also used for the tweet. So it should be action oriented and grab attention 
If you update the description, please update the description: in the frontmatter as well.

**Run BERT NLP models locally in Excel with ONNX and JavaScript**

<!-- README
The following is the intro to the post. It should be a short teaser for the post.
-->

Yesterday was all about building cross-platform intelligent apps with .NET MAUI and ONNX. Today is for people looking to extend Excel with BERT-JS and the ONNX Runtime. Wait, was "Excel, BERT-JS, and ONNX" used in the same sentence?😄 Yup, they were, so follow along to learn more.

## 🎯 What we'll cover

<!-- README
The following list is the main points of the post. There should be 3-4 main points.
 -->


- Excel Add-ins with Natural Language Processing using BERT and the ONNX Runtime.
- Step-by-step instructions and code examples.

<!-- 
- Main point 1
- Main point 2
- Main point 3 
- Main point 4

## 🚌 Build an Excel Add-in with BERT-JS and ONNX runtime

Read [today's article](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/excel-addin-bert-js.html) about building an Excel Add-in with BERT-JS and ONNX Runtime".  You'll learn about the use of BERT-JS and ONNX Runtime enables the creation of an Excel add-in that performs natural language processing tasks within a spreadsheet. 

BERT, a deep learning model developed by Google, is designed to understand the context and meaning of words in text. By using a transformer-based architecture, BERT can analyze entire sentences or paragraphs rather than processing words one by one. [Today's article](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/excel-addin-bert-js.html) provides step-by-step instructions and code examples to help readers follow along in building the add-in.
