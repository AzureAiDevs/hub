## 🗓️ Day 12 of #30DaysOfAzureAI

<!-- Short description section -->

**Build an Excel Add-in with ONNX Runtime Web for NLP Tasks**

<!-- Intro section -->

Yesterday was all about building cross-platform intelligent apps with .NET MAUI and ONNX. Today is for people looking to extend Excel with BERT NLP tasks enabled by ONNX Runtime Web in JavaScript. Wait, was "Excel, BERT, JavaScript and ONNX" used in the same sentence?😄 Yup, they were, so follow along to learn more.

## 🎯 What we'll cover

<!-- What we'll cover section -->


- Excel Add-ins with Natural Language Processing using BERT and the ONNX Runtime.
- Step-by-step instructions and code examples.

## 🚌 Build an Excel Add-in with ONNX Runtime Web for Inferencing NLP models on Device

Read [today's article](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/excel-addin-bert-js.html) about building an Excel Add-in with ONNX Runtime and JavaScript with on device inferencing. You'll learn how ONNX Runtime enables the inference of ML models cross-platform even locally in an Excel add-in! 

The tasks in this example will show you how to perform the natural language processing tasks of sentiment analysis and question and answering all locally within a spreadsheet.  [Today's article](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/excel-addin-bert-js.html) provides step-by-step instructions and code examples to help readers follow along in building the add-in.
