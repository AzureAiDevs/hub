## 🚌 Advances in GitHub's Copilot code generative models

[Today's article](https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-now-has-a-better-ai-model-and-new-capabilities/) looks at the updates to GitHub's Copilot with the goal of improving code suggestions and responsiveness for developers. The underlying Codex model has been updated to deliver better results for code synthesis and the Fill-In-the-Middle paradigm has been introduced for better prompts for code suggestions. 

Additionally, an AI-based vulnerability prevention system has been introduced to identify and block insecure coding patterns in real-time. The system uses language models to quickly detect vulnerable patterns, including hardcoded credentials and SQL injections, even in incomplete code fragments. Vulnerable code suggestions are replaced with alternative suggestions.
