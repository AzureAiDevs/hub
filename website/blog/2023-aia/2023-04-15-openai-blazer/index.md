## 🚌 Build and intelligent web apps with Blazor and Azure OpenAI

Read [today's article](https://blazorhelpwebsite.com/ViewBlogPost/2065) about Blazor, a new web framework for building single-page applications (SPAs) using .NET and C#. It allows developers to create client-side web applications with the same language and tools used to build server-side applications. You'll also find an extensive library of code samples and demos. These code samples will provide you with practical examples of how to use Blazor and Azure OpenAI to build real-world applications.
