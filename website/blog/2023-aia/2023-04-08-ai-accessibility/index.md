## 🚌 Build Accessible AI for Everyone

Read [today's article](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/ai-for-accessibility) for an overview of various AI for Accessibility projects that aim to improve the lives of people with disabilities. The projects range from education to employment, community, home, and low-cost assistive technology.  

One of the projects highlighted is NWEA, which is developing math assessments to make them more accessible for students with vision disabilities, improving their access to higher-level math and STEM careers. Another project is AI4Bharat, which aims to improve accessibility for the deaf population in India by creating datasets to advance Indian Sign Language understanding.
