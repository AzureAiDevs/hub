**Azure ML Managed Online Endpoints - A Quickstart**

<!-- README
The following is the intro to the post. It should be a short teaser for the post.
-->

Yesterday we learned how to streamline ML Development with Azure ML. Today, we'll learn how to deploy ML models using Azure ML managed online endpoints.

## 🎯 What we'll cover

<!-- README
The following list is the main points of the post. There should be 3-4 main points.
 -->


1. What are Azure ML managed online endpoints.
2. The three main components of an online endpoint.
3. How to deploy one or more models under the same endpoint.

<!-- 
- Main point 1
- Main point 2
- Main point 3 
- Main point 4

## 🚌 Get started with Azure ML's managed online endpoints

[Today's article](https://vladiliescu.net/aml-managed-endpoints-quickstart/) discusses the benefits of using Azure Machine Learning's managed online endpoints and compares them to Azure Container Instances. The author outlines three main reasons why they prefer managed online endpoints: built-in security, native blue/green deployments, and auto-scaling with Azure Monitor.

Step-by-step instructions are provided for for deploying an online endpoint that translates API inputs to something a machine learning model can handle, invokes the model, and returns formatted results.
