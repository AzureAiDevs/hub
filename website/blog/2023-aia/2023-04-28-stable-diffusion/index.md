**How to run Stable Diffusion Web UI on Azure ML compute instances**

<!-- README
The following is the intro to the post. It should be a short teaser for the post.
-->

Yesterday we learned about how to build a Patient Registration app with Azure Form Recognizer. Today's your opportunity to be "wowed" by the power of image generative models and run Stable Diffusion on Azure ML. Let's go!

## 🎯 What we'll cover

<!-- README
The following list is the main points of the post. There should be 3-4 main points.
 -->


- Stable Diffusion on Azure ML.
- Stable Diffusion on different GPU types.
- Code snippets to get started with Stable Diffusion on Azure ML.

<!-- 
- Main point 1
- Main point 2
- Main point 3 
- Main point 4
-->

## 🚌 Get Creative with Stable Diffusion on Azure ML

[Today's article](https://vladiliescu.net/stable-diffusion-web-ui-on-azure-ml/) is takes you into the fascinating world of Stable Diffusion's image generative model. Stable Diffusion is a generative model that can generate images of faces, animals, and other objects, it's a lot of fun to play with, so let your imagination run wild.

You'll learn about the prerequisites required to create Azure resources and provides the code snippets to create a resource group, Azure ML workspace, and a GPU compute instance.
