## Day _20_ of #30DaysOfAzureAI

<!-- README
The following description is also used for the tweet. So it should be action oriented and grab attention 
If you update the description, please update the description: in the frontmatter as well.
-->

**Learn about Azure Machine Learning lifecycle and open source tooling to start building MLOps**

<!-- README
The following is the intro to the post. It should be a short teaser for the post.
-->

Yesterday we learned about the Azure ML Responsible AI Dashboard. Today is an introduction to Azure MLOps, where you'll learn how to "productionalize" ML models with Azure ML.

## What we'll cover

<!-- README
The following list is the main points of the post. There should be 3-4 main points.
 -->


The three main points covered are:
1. Identifying the different steps of the ML lifecycle
2. Describing how to create and manage machine learning models using MLOps processes
3. Articulating processes to monitor models and respond to incidents.

<!-- 
- Main point 1
- Main point 2
- Main point 3 
- Main point 4
