**Learn key Azure ML Concepts with this primer**

<!-- README
The following is the intro to the post. It should be a short teaser for the post.
-->

Yesterday we talked about using Copilot to build an intelligent Receipt processing app. Today we'll explore Azure Machine Learning.

## What we'll cover

<!-- README
The following list is the main points of the post. There should be 3-4 main points.
 -->


- The main concepts in Azure ML to become effective at using the platform. 
- Understanding these concepts will make working with code samples easier. 
- The goal is to become more proficient using Azure ML.

<!-- 
- Main point 1
- Main point 2
- Main point 3

## Why Use Azure ML?

Today's article discusses the benefits of using cloud computing for machine learning projects and introduces the Azure ML platform. Azure ML enables users to train and deploy machine learning models in the cloud, and offers resources including workspaces, datastores, jobs, assets, compute, and endpoints. The article provides an overview of each resource and explains the different ways of creating them using Azure ML Studio, Azure CLI, Python SDK, and REST APIs. The article aims to provide readers with a foundational understanding of Azure ML concepts to follow the code samples in upcoming posts.
