**Explore Conversational AI with the Azure OpenAI Service Playground**

<!-- README
The following is the intro to the post. It should be a short teaser for the post.
-->

In recent years, OpenAI has become a household name in the tech industry with its development of generative models such as GPT-3 and DALL-E. In this article, we will explore conversational AI models and how to consume them via API directly from OpenAI. We will also delve into how to tune hyperparameters to tailor your models to your use case and needs. By creating an Azure OpenAI instance and utilizing the OpenAI Playground, we will experiment with the available models and learn how to select the right one for our needs. So, get ready to dive into the world of language models and hyperparameters with OpenAI!

## What we'll cover

<!-- README
The following list is the main points of the post. There should be 3-4 main points.
 -->


- Azure OpenAI Playground: a user-friendly interface for machine learning models.
- Features: custom data sets, experiment management, and model visualization.
- Scalable, flexible, and available at different price points.

## Getting started with the Azure OpenAI Service Playground

This article provides an overview of language models and hyperparameters, with a focus on conversational AI models from OpenAI. The article covers how to consume these models via API directly from OpenAI, as well as how to tune hyperparameters to tailor the models to specific use cases and needs. The author also provides a step-by-step guide to setting up an Azure OpenAI instance to access the OpenAI Playground for experimentation. The article examines the (hyper)parameters to be tuned, such as temperature, max length, stop sequences, top probabilities, frequency penalty, presence penalty, and best of. The article concludes by highlighting the three main categories of models offered by OpenAI: GPT-3, Codex, and Embeddings, and the different models available within each category.
