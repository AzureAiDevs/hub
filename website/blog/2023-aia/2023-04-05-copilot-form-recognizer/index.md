## üöå How Copilot helped a developer write a Form Recognizer app

Read [today's article](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-cognitive-services-blog/how-copilot-helps-developers-generate-code-for-a-form-recognizer/ba-p/3753813) to learn how you can use Copilot to help build an app that recognizers printed receipts using the Azure Form Recognizer Cognitive Service. It is a great example of how Copilot can help you to generate code for your AI applications.
