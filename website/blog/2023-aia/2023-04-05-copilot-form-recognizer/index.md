## üóìÔ∏è Day _4_ of #30DaysOfAzureAI

<!-- README
The following description is also used for the tweet. So it should be action oriented and grab attention 
If you update the description, please update the description: in the frontmatter as well.
-->

**Learn how to use Copilot to build an intelligent Receipt Recognition App powered by Azure Form Recognizer**

<!-- README
The following is the intro to the post. It should be a short teaser for the post.
-->

Yesterday we talked about using Azure OpenAI Service playground to explore conversational AI. Today we'll explore how you can use GitHub Copilot as your programming buddy to build an intelligent Receipt processing App.

## üéØ What we'll cover

<!-- README
The following list is the main points of the post. There should be 3-4 main points.
 -->


1. GitHub Copilot uses AI to revolutionize programming.
2. CoPilot increase efficiency and productivity for developers.
3. A tutorial is provided on how to integrate Python with the Azure Form Recognizer API using GitHub Copilot

<!-- 
- Main point 1
- Main point 2
- Main point 3 
- Main point 4

## How Copilot helps developers generate code for a Form Recognizer application

This is a excellent tutorial on how you can use Copilot to help build an app that recognizers printed receipts using the Azure Form Recognizer Cognitive Service. It is a great example of how Copilot can help you to generate code for your AI applications.

Be sure to check it out here: [How Copilot helps developers generate code for a Form Recognizer application](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-cognitive-services-blog/how-copilot-helps-developers-generate-code-for-a-form-recognizer/ba-p/3753813)




<!-- The article is about Azure Cognitive Services, which are cloud-based AI services that can be integrated into applications to provide many intelligent features. The services are provided through REST APIs and client library SDKs in different programming languages, and they are divided into five main categories: Vision, Speech, Language, Decision, and Azure OpenAI Service. The article outlines the various services available within each category, and how they can be used to add cognitive features to applications. It also covers topics such as regional availability, language support, security, certifications and compliance, and help and support options. Additionally, the article provides a comprehensive overview of how the services can be used in different development environments. In short, Azure Cognitive Services is a powerful tool for developers to add intelligent features to their applications. -->
