**Building a Patient Registration Web App with Azure Form Recognizer**

<!-- README
The following is the intro to the post. It should be a short teaser for the post.
-->

Transform manual form filling into an automated process with Azure Form Recognizer in this workshop! With Azure services and a focus on improving the patient experience, you'll create a custom model and integrate it into a web-based patient registration system. By the end, you'll have a solution that streamlines the registration process, providing more efficient and accurate data extraction. Don't miss out on harnessing the power of AI with Azure Form Recognizer!

## What we'll cover

<!-- README
The following list is the main points of the post. There should be 3-4 main points.
 -->


- Automate the manual form filling process using Azure Form Recognizer
- Improve the patient experience by integrating a web-based patient registration system
- Achieve a more efficient and accurate system for data extraction with a custom Azure Form Recognizer model.

Are you tired of manually filling out paper-based forms? Do you wish there was a way to automate the process? Look no further than Azure Form Recognizer, a new Cognitive Service that uses machine learning to extract text and table data from form documents. In this workshop, you'll learn how to infuse AI technologies into a web-based patient registration system using Azure services such as Azure Static Web apps, Azure Functions, Azure Cognitive Services, Azure Storage, and Azure Cosmos DB.

The goal of the workshop is to improve the patient experience by automating the paper-based patient registration process at a doctor's surgery. You'll learn how to create a custom Azure Form Recognizer model, integrate it with a web app, and define application roles that map to workshop personas such as surgery admin, nurse, and doctor. By the end of the workshop, you'll have a working solution that allows new patients to complete the registration form online, the web app to extract the data, and the surgery admin to verify and add the registration to the doctor's surgery system. Say goodbye to manual form filling and hello to the power of AI technologies with Azure Form Recognizer!
