:::tip ROADMAP
This is the roadmap for #30DaysOfAzureAI, a series of daily content posts all through #AiApril. Hear from our experts in the product teams, cloud advocacy, community and follow along at your own pace! Where relevant, the daily posts have accompanying Open Source repositories, code samples, and other resources.
:::

We've organized the content into 4 themed weeks. Based on your role with the topic, you can choose specific weeks or posts to check out. If you are new to Azure AI development, we recommend you read the posts in order.

* **🏁 Fundamentals** of Azure OpenAI, Azure ML, AI for Accessibility, and Responsible AI. This week should be of interest to everyone
* **👩‍💻 Build intelligent apps** with Azure AI services like OpenAI and embedded ML models. This week is for app developers wanting to build intelligent apps using models or services trained by others.
* **🧑🏽‍🔬 Building and managing ML models** with Azure ML, MLOps and Responsible AI. This week is for Data Scientists, ML, or MLOps Engineers who build and manage ML models.
* **🏭 Workshop** your way through beginners content for Data Scientist, AL, ML, MLOps, and two cognitive services labs. This week is for everyone.
