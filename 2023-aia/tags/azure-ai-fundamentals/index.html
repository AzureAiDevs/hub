The speaker also talks about the need to set the right mental model for users of AI-generated information. </p><p>Transcript: &quot;These models-- you&#x27;ve got text-to-speech. You&#x27;ve got, rather, I should say, text-to-image with DAL-E. You&#x27;ve got coding. You&#x27;ve got language. Your ChatGPT has completely changed the conversation about AI. I think those of us who have been on the inside of AI definitely have thought about it as, of course, it&#x27;s changing the world, and we see it every day. But I think ChatGPT made it real for millions of people by showing them what it can do and how powerful it is, and their imaginations are now freed. How can this be really useful towards someone who may have, say, limited mobility? One of my colleagues, Christina, her arms are paralyzed, and she types with her toes. And watching her use this product is really cool because she said, oh, I just have to type one sentence rather than typing lots of sentences to plan a trip, for example. How do we set the right mental model for a technology like this? It&#x27;s super impressive. It can create. It can cite information. And so, we found that people tend to over trust or over rely the kind of information it generates. And so, a lot of what our team did was, like, how do you set the right mental model for users, reminding them, hey, this is from the internet, just as reliable as the internet. Some things are factual. Some things are not.  So, hi, everyone. Welcome to the Global AI Bootcamp 2023. We welcome you as one of the attendees of our yearly global event with more than 70 locations around the world. Sammy, do you know that this is already the fifth event in a row? Five already? Yes. OK. It&#x27;s a 5th anniversary. Wow. It&#x27;s crazy. Time really flies. Yeah. We started in 2018, together with the Global HRD Community. And then, in 2019, it really exploded, with lots of locations around the globe. Exactly. Then, we had a couple of years, which were virtual and some were hybrid. And now, we&#x27;re back with our 5th, anniversary of big events, with lots of locations around the world. It&#x27;s really a nice history already, but I think there&#x27;s a lot of people also that we need to thank. And actually, those people are, right now, together with you, in the room. And as the local organizers, they&#x27;ve been working hard to find a venue to find speakers, to find sponsors, or maybe even catering for some foods. So please, thank you to all the local organizers. Give them a random applause for all the work that they&#x27;ve been doing. I think they really earn it because of doing all that kind of work. Yes, thank you. Yeah. But there&#x27;s also some other people who have been doing a lot of work over the last five years, and one person, specifically-- well, it&#x27;s sad that you cannot see him, but we can see him. So give me a second. Let me switch on my phone and my camera. Here. Do you see this guy here? He&#x27;s one of the founding fathers of the Global AI Community and has been working for us for over five years, of course, doing everything. And now, somehow, he found a new passion in producing videos like this. So should we go inside? Let&#x27;s go inside. OK, let&#x27;s go. Come on inside.  So, hi, John. Welcome to the Global AI Bootcamp. Hi, thank you very much for having me. Yes. And thank you for being here with me. It&#x27;s my pleasure. Yeah. Before we start, can you tell us who you are and what you do at Microsoft? Sure. I&#x27;m John Montgomery, and I am the corporate vice president of product, in charge of Azure AI, which includes the Azure Cognitive Services, Azure OpenAI Service, Azure machine learning, and our AI frameworks. So if we look at the past year, what is your most memorable moment in terms of AI advancements? The last year has been amazing. I tend to think about the world in terms of customer impact, more so than like research impact or product advances. And in the last year, I would say, we&#x27;ve seen several interesting customer things happen. One of the biggest-- I mean, I could pick-- so there are little ones, like the improvements we&#x27;ve seen in our cognitive, like neural voices. The quality is getting better. It&#x27;s taking less training data, and that&#x27;s enabled customers like Duolingo to add languages and to make the interactions more personal. We&#x27;ve done a whole bunch inside of Azure machine learning to make it scale better, to make training better. And that&#x27;s impacted a bunch of customers, ranging from big ones, like Chevron to some of our newer customers. I think, though, if you look back at the last year, probably, the single biggest thing is around Azure OpenAI service going general availability and ChatGPT. And those are, probably, the biggest things in the last year. ChatGPT has completely changed the conversation about AI. I think those of us who have been on the inside of AI definitely have thought about it as-- of course, it&#x27;s changing the world, and we see it every day. But I think ChatGPT made it real for millions of people by showing them what it can do and how powerful it is, and their imaginations are now freed. Yeah, that&#x27;s totally true. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of times now, and it is really, really big. And it&#x27;s really game changing. I have to ask you then, what&#x27;s the coolest thing you&#x27;ve done with ChatGPT? Oh, I have written some social media posts for my podcast. Cool. It&#x27;s very good at it, even better than I am. It is very good at things like that, yes. Yeah, totally true. You also lead a team at Microsoft, and that team focuses on building tools that are used by customers to create their own AI solutions. So can you share a customer story with us that really stood out for you? Wow.  So when I think about my customers, I really kind of think about it in two cohorts. Microsoft is actually my largest customer. All of the AI services at Microsoft, they&#x27;re using Azure machine learning for training or for inference. They&#x27;re calling our cognitive services. They&#x27;re using Azure OpenAI Service, and that includes things like GitHub Copilot, which is built on Azure OpenAI. It includes things like Dynamics 365. I think, though, from a first party perspective, in the last few days, we&#x27;ve seen some really huge announcements. It was one that actually happened just today, where we&#x27;re seeing the potential of ChatGPT, like things in Bing. We&#x27;ve also seen a massive announcement around Viva Sales and Teams premium. We&#x27;ve been working for years with the Teams team to do transcription of meetings. And that transcription can drive things like closed captioning. But we haven&#x27;t tapped the full potential until Teams Premium came out. And now, you can get meetings summaries sent to you and action items assigned to you in Teams. And that&#x27;s just showing the power of what AI can do. So from a first party perspective, I think that one is super interesting. From a a third party customer perspective, I&#x27;m going to pick a totally different one. And I would focus more on the impact that some of our responsible AI tooling has had. The National Health Service in the UK has been completely inundated since the start of COVID. And they have been using the responsible AI tools inside Azure Machine Learning to help drive clarity and confidence in some of the machine learning models they&#x27;ve created to figure out where surgery patients should go for their hip and knee surgeries, whether they need to go to a major medical center, or they can go to a smaller regional medical center based on a risk assessment profile. And so, obviously, helping customers is huge. And that was just an amazing example of, basically, doctors working with their data science teams to help an immediate and local problem using the tools my team creates. What do you think are the three topics that people should be educated in? I&#x27;d call out three things. These models, it doesn&#x27;t work that way. I mean, these models take months to train on supercomputers, right? And I think, now, we&#x27;re starting to give people fine tuning APIs and more and more tools on top of it. Understanding what you can do with these, understanding prompt engineering and what&#x27;s coming after that, that is a major thing for everybody. Absolutely. Yes. Thank you so much, John, for being here with me. Thank you. It&#x27;s been great to be here. Thank you. Well, that was a very interesting conversation you had with John. He really showed us what the strategy Microsoft has for implementing AI in their products and also the future that they are looking into. So in the case of OpenAI, it has fantastic language capabilities with the GPT 3 models. Also, one of the cousins of that is ChatGPT, which has really captured the hearts and the minds of everyone around the world. And there&#x27;s also the ability to do text-to-image the DALL-E model. And then, last, we have codex-- extremely important, really, to democratize software development and providing people access to SQL databases that aren&#x27;t SQL devs. But in enterprises, company secrets and so forth are not going to go back into the model training. But so, we have the best of both worlds. We have OpenAI continually retraining, and then our enterprise customers, with that data security value that we provide. Which is very important, of course. It&#x27;s quite interesting. They&#x27;re the same code base, the same instances of the models. When you get Text-Davinci-003 on OpenAI, you can take that work, reproduce it, again, within the stochastic characteristics of the models, and get the same type of answers. So we see customers working on OpenAI and then directly transferring that knowledge over to Azure OpenAI Service very seamlessly. So you&#x27;ve talked now how enterprise organizations are already making use of these services. Can you give us any example, a use case? Oh, yeah, absolutely. So we see, with use cases, the language use cases are grouped into four buckets or broad categories. The first, we call reason over structured and unstructured data. It is done out there. And then, also, we see a lot in marketing campaigns for developing taglines, for email headers, et cetera. So there are a few case studies that were out there. I mentioned Trelent. CarMax is a customer that&#x27;s been using it to summarize thousands of automobile reviews, down to a very coherent description, saving thousands of hours of collating all that information together. You&#x27;ve got language. Multimodal is something that we&#x27;re looking at, moving forward, where these multiple model capabilities are all converging onto a single model, a single API. So that&#x27;s something to look forward to. Also, being used for more forward-looking, like external users, social media type things. I&#x27;m really looking forward to everything that this is going to bring in the upcoming years. For sure. I&#x27;m also looking forward to that. But I think our next guest will really giving us an example how OpenAI has been embedded in a business application. Let&#x27;s have a view also on that. Let&#x27;s do that. And so, that was our initial step, was really around education around user transparency. But there&#x27;s so many more places that we want to go to in terms of what is the future human-AI interaction model that we really want to create with the technology like this. OK, it&#x27;s quite interesting. Now, the tool that-- well, the model that is used behind the service is ChatGPT, where it consumes a lot of data to get trained. I would say, on the platform level, there&#x27;s been a lot of work in terms of safety, like content moderation, how do we think about safe inputs and outputs. If users tend to ask Bing, hey, I got this prescription from my medication. Does that look right? It will tell you, hey, you should consult the medical professional. For example, back to the ChatGPT scenario. If people are using it for medical professionals, even if doctors aren&#x27;t directly using it, it might affect them. Because their patients might not be going to them and say, hey, I got this prescription or this diagnosis. What do you think? And so, we think about those different layers. Looking forward to see more of you and your team, also read articles or see videos about it. Thank you very much. Thanks. Well, that was a really interesting conversation I just had. I&#x27;m really looking forward to where AI is going to be embedded in even more business applications. Yeah, me, too. And there is also another field where AI can have a huge impact. You&#x27;re not making like Uber for fresh fruit, right? It&#x27;s got a real reason to exist, all this cool innovation. And when you look at the intersection of the two, you&#x27;re looking at ways, where you&#x27;re literally solving the equity divide. And there&#x27;s three things that I&#x27;ve seen Microsoft do in the last few years that I think it&#x27;s really important to call out. They&#x27;re part of their nightly insider builds, and there&#x27;s a brand new one called Explain, where you can highlight a chunk of code, and they&#x27;ll explain on natural language what it does. I use it when I&#x27;m getting familiar with the new code base or some product that I&#x27;ve never worked with before. Like, yes, I can use them, but they&#x27;re useful and usable, right? So, how can this be really useful toward someone who may have, say, limited mobility? One of my colleagues, Christina, her arms are paralyzed, and she types with her toes. And watching her use this product is really cool because she said, oh, I know just have to type one sentence rather than typing lots of sentences to plan a trip, for example. So you can imagine, that&#x27;s a game changer for people because it gives you this easy button shortcut key toward not having to read a large quantity of words, if you are a dyslexic person like me. Yeah, that&#x27;s really a major step forward for including everyone here. That&#x27;s right. And just making life easier for all kinds of people.&quot;</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-read-todays-article">👓 Read today&#x27;s article<a href="#-read-todays-article" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 👓 Read today&#x27;s article" title="Direct link to 👓 Read today&#x27;s article">​</a></h2><p>Today&#x27;s <a href="https://youtu.be/D7_RN5Gc-RE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="️-questions">🙋🏾‍♂️ Questions?<a href="#️-questions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🙋🏾‍♂️ Questions?" title="Direct link to 🙋🏾‍♂️ Questions?">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/1-kick-starting-ai-april!" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remember, you can ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-30-days-roadmap">📍 30 days roadmap<a href="#-30-days-roadmap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 📍 30 days roadmap" title="Direct link to 📍 30 days roadmap">​</a></h2><p>What&#x27;s next?
