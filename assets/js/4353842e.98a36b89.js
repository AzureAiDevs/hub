It should be an overview of the post that you are referencing.\\nSee the Learn More section, if you supplied a canonical link, then will be displayed here.\\n--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude8c Introduction\\n\\nIn today\'s post, distinguished engineer Pablo Castro covers two questions we hear most often:\\n\\n1. How do I build my own ChatGPT that uses my own data as the basis for its responses?\\n1. How do I integrate Azure OpenAI Service into my application?\\n\\n## Building your own ChatGPT\\n\\nRead the full article that addresses the question [\u201cHow do I build something like ChatGPT that uses my own data as the basis for its responses?\u201d](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-applied-ai-blog/revolutionize-your-enterprise-data-with-chatgpt-next-gen-apps-w/ba-p/3762087?WT.mc_id=aiml-89446-dglover)\\n\\n\x3c!-- In summary, the combination of Azure Cognitive Search and Azure OpenAI Service yields an effective solution for this scenario. \\nIt integrates the enterprise-grade characteristics of Azure, the ability of Cognitive Search to index, understand and retrieve the right pieces of your own data across large knowledge bases, \\nand ChatGPT\u2019s impressive capability for interacting in natural language to answer questions or take turns in a conversation. --\x3e\\n\\n![The image shows the architecture](architecture.png)\\n\\n## Integrating Azure OpenAI Service into my apps\\n\\n### Scenario One: Converse with Minecraft\\n\\nTransforming the surface area of an app might be easier than you think!\\nIn this video segment, Pablo shows us how he used Minecraft\'s extension\\nAPIs to integrate a conversational user interaction model to build in\\nMinecraft.\\n\\nThe add-in module, named \\"conjure\\", collects a text input that\'s passed\\nto Codex, transforming user intent into actionable code that Minecraft\\nunderstands.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3t3qZu1Dy1k?start=341\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\nIf your application supports plug-in or add-on modules, you can attach a\\nmodule that accepts text prompts as inputs, and then pass that input to\\nCodex to interpret the user intent. Codex returns native code that can\\nthen be processed by your application.\\n\\n### Scenario Two: Combine Content Discovery and Language Understanding to Create New Information\\n\\nThe next example combines the content discovery capabilities of Azure\\nCognitive Search with the language understanding of the GPT-3 model.\\n\\nThe premise is an app for a green energy company that helps users find\\nthe latest insights and developments by scanning content over large\\nvolumes of unstructured content from various sources.\\n\\n-   Cognitive Search accepts a user query and returns a set of matching\\n    documents in order of relevance. Instead of returning the results to\\n    the user, it sends them to GPT-3 for more analysis.\\n\\n-   GPT-3 takes the documents and composes better answers and insights\\n    using content from all of them.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3t3qZu1Dy1k?start=576\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\nIn this example, the app calls Azure Cognitive Search to discover\\ntext-based documents related to the user\'s question. This step finds the\\nmatches, ranks the documents, and returns the most relevant candidates.\\n\\n![Graphical user interface Description automatically generated](image3.png)\\n\\nBut sometimes the best answer isn\'t in one document. By adding language\\nunderstanding, the app can use GPT-3 to derive a new answer using the\\ncontent from all of the matching documents. This isn\'t just a verbatim\\nanswer from one document, but a new answer from multiple documents.\\n\\n![Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated](image4.png)\\n\\n## Key Takeaways and Next Steps\\n\\nNow that you\'ve seen a few examples, here are some next steps:\\n\\nSee how Microsoft integrates OpenAI into applications.
