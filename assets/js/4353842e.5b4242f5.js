How do I build my own ChatGPT that uses my own data as the basis for its responses?\\n1. How do I integrate Azure OpenAI Service into my application?\\n\\n## Building your own ChatGPT\\n\\nRead the full article that addresses the question [\u201cHow do I build something like ChatGPT that uses my own data as the basis for its responses?\u201d](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-applied-ai-blog/revolutionize-your-enterprise-data-with-chatgpt-next-gen-apps-w/ba-p/3762087?WT.mc_id=aiml-89446-dglover)\\n\\n\x3c!-- In summary, the combination of Azure Cognitive Search and Azure OpenAI Service yields an effective solution for this scenario. \\nIt integrates the enterprise-grade characteristics of Azure, the ability of Cognitive Search to index, understand and retrieve the right pieces of your own data across large knowledge bases, \\nand ChatGPT\u2019s impressive capability for interacting in natural language to answer questions or take turns in a conversation. --\x3e\\n\\n![The image shows the architecture](architecture.png)\\n\\n### View the companion video on YouTube\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tW2EA4aZ_YQ\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## How to integrate Azure OpenAI Services into my apps\\n\\n### Scenario One: Converse with Minecraft\\n\\nTransforming the surface area of an app might be easier than you think!\\nIn this video segment, Pablo shows us how he used Minecraft\'s extension\\nAPIs to integrate a conversational user interaction model to build in\\nMinecraft.\\n\\nThe add-in module, named \\"conjure\\", collects a text input that\'s passed\\nto Codex, transforming user intent into actionable code that Minecraft\\nunderstands.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3t3qZu1Dy1k?start=341\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\nIf your application supports plug-in or add-on modules, you can attach a\\nmodule that accepts text prompts as inputs, and then pass that input to\\nCodex to interpret the user intent. Codex returns native code that can\\nthen be processed by your application.\\n\\n### Scenario Two: Combine Content Discovery and Language Understanding to Create New Information\\n\\nThe next example combines the content discovery capabilities of Azure\\nCognitive Search with the language understanding of the GPT-3 model.\\n\\nThe premise is an app for a green energy company that helps users find\\nthe latest insights and developments by scanning content over large\\nvolumes of unstructured content from various sources.\\n\\n-   Cognitive Search accepts a user query and returns a set of matching\\n    documents in order of relevance. Instead of returning the results to\\n    the user, it sends them to GPT-3 for more analysis.\\n\\n-   GPT-3 takes the documents and composes better answers and insights\\n    using content from all of them.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3t3qZu1Dy1k?start=576\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\nIn this example, the app calls Azure Cognitive Search to discover\\ntext-based documents related to the user\'s question. This step finds the\\nmatches, ranks the documents, and returns the most relevant candidates.\\n\\n![Graphical user interface Description automatically generated](image3.png)\\n\\nBut sometimes the best answer isn\'t in one document. By adding language\\nunderstanding, the app can use GPT-3 to derive a new answer using the\\ncontent from all of the matching documents. This isn\'t just a verbatim\\nanswer from one document, but a new answer from multiple documents.\\n\\n![Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated](image4.png)\\n\\n## Key Takeaways and Next Steps\\n\\nNow that you\'ve seen a few examples, here are some next steps:\\n\\nSee how Microsoft integrates OpenAI into applications.

The underlying Codex model has been updated to deliver better results for code synthesis and the Fill-In-the-Middle paradigm has been introduced for better prompts for code suggestions. \\n\\nAdditionally, an AI-based vulnerability prevention system has been introduced to identify and block insecure coding patterns in real-time. The system uses language models to quickly detect vulnerable patterns, including hardcoded credentials and SQL injections, even in incomplete code fragments.

[Today\'s article](https://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/aml-command) is a hands-on introduction to the most fundamental operations of Azure ML: training and deploying a machine learning model in the cloud. It discusses which resources you need to create, and the three main methods of creating them: the Azure ML CLI, the Python SDK, and the Studio UI.\\n\\nThe goal for today is for you to have a deep technical understanding of the basics of Azure ML. The article demonstrates how to train and deploy a simple model, but you\'ll be able to apply the same concepts to your own ML projects, regardless of their complexity.\xdf\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc53 View today\'s article\\n\\nToday\'s [article](https://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/aml-command).\\n\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Questions?\\n\\n[You can ask questions about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/azure-ml-developers)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udccd 30 days roadmap\\n\\nWhat\'s next?

The Azure MLOps (v2) Solution Accelerator is a project designed to simplify the implementation of MLOps in Azure. \\n\\nMLOps is a set of automated and collaborative workflows that allow teams of machine learning professionals to quickly and easily deploy their models into production. \\n\\nThe solution accelerator provides a modular end-to-end approach based on pattern architectures, with the goals of simplicity, modularity, repeatability, security, collaboration, and enterprise readiness. It achieves these goals with a template-based approach for end-to-end data science, driving operational efficiency at each stage. The solution accelerator is designed to be customizable to fit each organization\'s unique needs and can be up and running in just a few hours.\\n\\n## Watch the Azure MLOps (v2) Solution Accelerator Overview Video\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5yPDkWCMmtk\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc53 View today\'s article\\n\\nToday\'s [article](https://github.com/Azure/mlops-v2).\\n\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Questions?\\n\\n[You can ask questions about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/azure-ai-workshops)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udccd 30 days roadmap\\n\\nWhat\'s next?
