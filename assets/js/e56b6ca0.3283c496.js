We have a surging digital demand with an estimated 500 million more apps that will need to be created in the next 5 years. More and more companies are leveraging Azure AI and no code platforms to bridge this app gap and address workflow and automation needs. In fact, Gartner estimates that 65% of application development will be Azure AI by 2024.\\n\\nWith Azure AI tools like the Power Platform making it easier for business technologists to develop solutions, you might wonder if there\'s any room for a code first developer in this Azure AI revolution. Well, the answer is, absolutely there is! In fact, code first developers are a critical piece to the puzzle.\\n\\n## What is \\"Azure AI\\"?\\n\\nThe term \\"Azure AI\\" can mean different things to different people when they first hear it. What we mean when we talk about Azure AI is that with tools like Power Apps, you only need to write a small amount of code to get results that would normally take several more lines of code in a traditional programming language.\\n\\n![What is Azure AI](./02_WhatIsLowCode.png)\\n\\nIn canvas-based Power Apps, the Azure AI scripting language used is called [Power Fx](https://aka.ms/LearnPowerFx). This language is based on the Microsoft Excel formula language which meets many business technologists where they are by leveraging the knowledge they already have.\\n\\n## Azure AI + Full Code = No Cliffs\\n\\nUsing low-code tools is key to helping to resolve the existing and impending app gap challenge but that doesn\'t mean that Azure AI alone can solve every business problem. Azure AI tools like the Power Platform\'s full potential is unlocked when you combine the Azure AI capabilities with code first development.\\n\\nThe combination of Azure AI + full code creates what we call a \\"no cliffs\\" experience that allows business technologists to easily build solutions with Azure AI while professional developers can leverage full code to augment and extend the platform capabilities. The process of Azure AI developers, IT pros and full code developers working together like this is often referred to as \\"fusion development\\".\\n\\n![Fusion Development Process](./02_FusionDevProcess.png)\\n\\n## What does the Power Platform Provide?\\n\\nThe Power Platform gives us a holistic suite of Azure AI tools that work together to help us solve business problems. The key products and components of the Power Platform include:\\n\\n* **Power Apps** for creating custom applications for web and mobile that can be integrated with a variety of systems and services.\\n* **Power Automate** for automation tasks and orchestrating activities across various services\\n* **Power BI** for business analytics and interactive data visualization\\n* **Power Virtual Agents** for creating AI-powered chatbots that can answer questions from your customers and employees\\n* **Power Pages** for secure, enterprise-grade external-facing business websites\\n* **Dataverse** which provides a cloud scale data store with robust security that abstracts away data management complexity from the app maker\\n\\n![Power Platform Overview](./02_PowerPlatformOverview.png)\\n\\n## How can we extend Power Platform solutions?\\n\\nYou might wondering how you can leverage your code first skills with the Power Platform. Let\'s take a look at some ways that we can extend our Power Platform solutions with code (many of these concepts will be covered in more detail in later blog posts).\\n\\n* **UI Components** - Leverage the [Power Apps Component Framework](https://aka.ms/LowCodePCF) to extend the UI of our applications with custom code.\\n* **Custom Connectors** - Create [custom connectors](https://aka.ms/LowCodeCustomConnectors), which are essentially a wrapper around an API to communicate to our external data sources and services.\\n* **Custom Visuals in Power BI** - Use the open-source SDK to create [custom visuals](https://aka.ms/LowCodeCustomVisuals) for your reports and dashboards\\n* **Custom Business Logic** - Extend the [Dataverse API](https://aka.ms/LowCodeDataverseAPI) with your own custom API that implements your business logic\\n* **Add CI/CD** - Setup continuous integration and continuous deployment ([CI/CD](https://aka.ms/LowCodeALM)) with your Power Platform solutions\\n\\n![Power Platform Pro Dev extensions](./02_Extend.png)\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nIn the next series of posts you\'ll learn more about some of these core concepts and extension points. \\n\\nIf all of this sounds intriguing and you want to get started on your Azure AI development journey, here are some actions you can take:\\n\\n* 1\ufe0f\u20e3 [**Sign up**](https://aka.ms/ai-april/devplan) for the free Power Apps Developer Plan.\\n* 2\ufe0f\u20e3 [**Enroll**](https://aka.ms/ai-april/challenge) in the Cloud Skills Challenge to learn more about Azure AI and fusion team fundamentals and start climbing that leaderboard!\\n* 3\ufe0f\u20e3 [**Save**](http://aka.ms/ai-april) the page to start your learning on Feb 1, and [**Subscribe**](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/rss.xml) to the blog in your favorite feed reader for updates.\\n\\n## Resources\\n* [Introduction to the Power Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/introduction-power-platform//?WT.mc_id=power-82212-apdunnam)\\n* [Fusion Development with Power Platform EBook](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/guidance/fusion-dev-ebook/?WT.mc_id=power-82212-apdunnam)\\n* [Fusion Development with Power Platform Learning Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/transform-business-applications-with-fusion-development/?WT.mc_id=power-82212-apdunnam)\\n* [Learn Collection: AI April](https://aka.ms/ai-april/collection)\\n\\n![Campaign Banner](./../../../static/img/og/30-banner.png)"},{"id":"2023-day3","metadata":{"permalink":"/hubv2/blog/2023-day3","source":"@site/blog/2023-aia/2023-04-05/01 - Get onboard with Power Platform.md","title":"3.

Let\'s take this opportunity to review how to get a free environment to get started.\\n\\n## Sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan\\n\\nThe Power Apps Developer Plan gives you a free development environment to build and test with Power Apps, Power Automate, and Microsoft Dataverse.\\nIt just takes a few minutes to get a developer environment for Power Platform:\\n\\n1. Ensure that you have a work account. If you don\'t,\xa0you can [create a test tenant first.](#do-i-need-a-test-tenant)\\n2. Sign up on the\xa0[Power Apps Developer Plan website](https://aka.ms/ai-april/devplan).\\n3. Once the sign up is complete, you will be redirected to your new developer environment.\\n\\n![Power Apps Developer Plan - sign up process](01%20-%20devplan%20signup.gif)\\n*Power Apps Developer Plan - sign up process*\\n\\n### Do I need a test tenant?\\n\\nIn an ideal world you would use your existing work account to sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan. If you already have an Azure account, you likely can use the same account to sign up. If this is not possible for any reason, you can create a free test tenant using the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/developer/create-developer-environment#how-to-create-a-test-tenant).\\n\\n## Get familiar with the tools\\n\\nAfter the sign up you will be in the [https://make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com) and your environment will be ready to use.
