If inputs or\\ngenerated outputs include inappropriate content, the Azure OpenAI\\nService catches it. Detection and mitigation of harmful use follows the\\nresponsible AI principles, which you can find more about at\\n[aka.ms/AIprinciples](https://aka.ms/AIprinciples).\\n\\nIn this session, we\'ll unpack the core concepts for interacting with\\nmodels, using prompts, and demonstrate how you can use Azure\'s OpenAI\\nStudio to experiment with and test your models before bringing them into\\nyour code to deliver differentiated app experiences, all with Azure\'s\\nenterprise-grade security for your app\'s foundation.\\n\\n## Scenario One: Converse with Minecraft\\n\\nTransforming the surface area of an app might be easier than you think!\\nIn this video segment, Pablo shows us how he used Minecraft\'s extension\\nAPIs to integrate a conversational user interaction model to build in\\nMinecraft.\\n\\nThe add-in module, named \\"conjure\\", collects a text input that\'s passed\\nto Codex, transforming user intent into actionable code that Minecraft\\nunderstands.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3t3qZu1Dy1k?start=341\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\nIf your application supports plug-in or add-on modules, you can attach a\\nmodule that accepts text prompts as inputs, and then pass that input to\\nCodex to interpret the user intent. Codex returns native code that can\\nthen be processed by your application.\\n\\n## Scenario Two: Combine Content Discovery and Language Understanding to Create New Information\\n\\nThe next example combines the content discovery capabilities of Azure\\nCognitive Search with the language understanding of the GPT-3 model.\\n\\nThe premise is an app for a green energy company that helps users find\\nthe latest insights and developments by scanning content over large\\nvolumes of unstructured content from various sources.\\n\\n-   Cognitive Search accepts a user query and returns a set of matching\\n    documents in order of relevance. Instead of returning the results to\\n    the user, it sends them to GPT-3 for more analysis.\\n\\n-   GPT-3 takes the documents and composes better answers and insights\\n    using content from all of them.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3t3qZu1Dy1k?start=576\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\nIn this example, the app calls Azure Cognitive Search to discover\\ntext-based documents related to the user\'s question. This step finds the\\nmatches, ranks the documents, and returns the most relevant candidates.\\n\\n![Graphical user interface Description automatically generated](image3.png)\\n\\nBut sometimes the best answer isn\'t in one document. By adding language\\nunderstanding, the app can use GPT-3 to derive a new answer using the\\ncontent from all of the matching documents. This isn\'t just a verbatim\\nanswer from one document, but a new answer from multiple documents.\\n\\n![Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated](image4.png)\\n\\n## Key Takeaways and Next Steps\\n\\nNow that you\'ve seen a few examples, here are some next steps:\\n\\nSee how Microsoft integrates OpenAI into applications.

[Today\'s article](https://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/aml-command) is a hands-on introduction to the most fundamental operations of Azure ML: training and deploying a machine learning model in the cloud. It discusses which resources you need to create, and the three main methods of creating them: the Azure ML CLI, the Python SDK, and the Studio UI.\\n\\nThe goal for today is for you to have a deep technical understanding of the basics of Azure ML.

The Azure MLOps (v2) Solution Accelerator is a project designed to simplify the implementation of MLOps in Azure. \\n\\nMLOps is a set of automated and collaborative workflows that allow teams of machine learning professionals to quickly and easily deploy their models into production. \\n\\nThe solution accelerator provides a modular end-to-end approach based on pattern architectures, with the goals of simplicity, modularity, repeatability, security, collaboration, and enterprise readiness. It achieves these goals with a template-based approach for end-to-end data science, driving operational efficiency at each stage.

By leveraging machine learning algorithms, Azure Personalizer can optimize personalized recommendations and actions to achieve the goals of the application, such as maximizing engagement or revenue. With its scalability and easy integration, it can be used to deliver tailored content and actions to a large number of users, providing a more engaging and satisfying user experience.\\n\\nAll in all, Azure Personalizer helps developers create personalized experiences for their users at scale, which can lead to increased user satisfaction and retention.\\n\\n![Personalizer gif](Personalizer.gif)\\n\\nThis [Azure Personalizer Workshop](https://www.arafattehsin.com/tag/azure-personalizer/) provides a comprehensive guide on how to create a personalized user experience using Azure Personalizer. The [first](https://www.arafattehsin.com/reinforcement-learning-in-apps-bots-websites-with-azure-personalizer-part-1/) part of the series introduces the necessary concepts of Azure Personalizer, including how it uses machine learning algorithms to optimize personalized recommendations and actions.\\n\\nThe [second](https://www.arafattehsin.com/reinforcement-learning-in-apps-bots-websites-with-azure-personalizer-part-2/) part of the series focuses on creating a simulator to create and improve a Personalizer model before deploying it to production. This allows developers to test and refine their model before launching it to a large number of users.\\n\\nThe [final](https://www.arafattehsin.com/reinforcement-learning-in-apps-bots-websites-with-azure-personalizer-part-3/) part of the series demonstrates how to use the Personalizer model in a Power Virtual Agents bot with the Power Automate custom connector.\\n\\n![Image banner for day 27](PVA-demo.gif)\\n\\nBy following the steps outlined in the workshop, developers can create a more engaging and personalized user experience that can lead to increased user satisfaction and retention.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc53 Read today\'s article\\n\\nToday\'s [article](https://www.arafattehsin.com/reinforcement-learning-in-apps-bots-websites-with-azure-personalizer-part-1).\\n\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Questions?\\n\\n[Remember, you can ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/27-enhance-cx-with-azure-personalizer)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udccd 30 days roadmap\\n\\nWhat\'s next?
