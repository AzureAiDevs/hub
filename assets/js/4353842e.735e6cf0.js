It should be an overview of the post that you are referencing.\\nSee the Learn More section, if you supplied a canonical link, then will be displayed here.\\n--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude8c Learn how to use Azure OpenAI for your applications\\n\\nAzure\'s OpenAI Service lets you leverage large scale generative AI\\nmodels based in Azure that have a deep understanding of language and\\ncode as you build new applications. \\"Language understanding\\" means that\\nyou can type or \\"talk\\" to an app to get it do the things you want.\\n\\nIn Azure OpenAI, you can work with these models:\\n\\n-   GPT-3 generates content based on natural language input.\\n\\n-   Codex translates natural language instructions directly into code.\\n\\n-   DALL-E 2 generates realistic images and art from natural language\\n    descriptions.\\n\\nThese models are hosted on Azure, accessible to apps through REST APIs,\\nor through Azure OpenAI Studio for interactive exploration.\\n\\nAzure OpenAI models include built-in content filtering. If inputs or\\ngenerated outputs include inappropriate content, the Azure OpenAI\\nService catches it. Detection and mitigation of harmful use follows the\\nresponsible AI principles, which you can find more about at\\n[aka.ms/AIprinciples](https://aka.ms/AIprinciples).\\n\\nIn this session, we\'ll unpack the core concepts for interacting with\\nmodels, using prompts, and demonstrate how you can use Azure\'s OpenAI\\nStudio to experiment with and test your models before bringing them into\\nyour code to deliver differentiated app experiences, all with Azure\'s\\nenterprise-grade security for your app\'s foundation.\\n\\n## Scenario One: Converse with Minecraft\\n\\nTransforming the surface area of an app might be easier than you think!\\nIn this video segment, Pablo shows us how he used Minecraft\'s extension\\nAPIs to integrate a conversational user interaction model to build in\\nMinecraft.\\n\\nThe add-in module, named \\"conjure\\", collects a text input that\'s passed\\nto Codex, transforming user intent into actionable code that Minecraft\\nunderstands.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3t3qZu1Dy1k?start=341\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\nIf your application supports plug-in or add-on modules, you can attach a\\nmodule that accepts text prompts as inputs, and then pass that input to\\nCodex to interpret the user intent. Codex returns native code that can\\nthen be processed by your application.\\n\\n## Scenario Two: Combine Content Discovery and Language Understanding to Create New Information\\n\\nThe next example combines the content discovery capabilities of Azure\\nCognitive Search with the language understanding of the GPT-3 model.\\n\\nThe premise is an app for a green energy company that helps users find\\nthe latest insights and developments by scanning content over large\\nvolumes of unstructured content from various sources.\\n\\n-   Cognitive Search accepts a user query and returns a set of matching\\n    documents in order of relevance. Instead of returning the results to\\n    the user, it sends them to GPT-3 for more analysis.\\n\\n-   GPT-3 takes the documents and composes better answers and insights\\n    using content from all of them.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3t3qZu1Dy1k?start=576\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\nIn this example, the app calls Azure Cognitive Search to discover\\ntext-based documents related to the user\'s question. This step finds the\\nmatches, ranks the documents, and returns the most relevant candidates.\\n\\n![Graphical user interface Description automatically generated](image3.png)\\n\\nBut sometimes the best answer isn\'t in one document. By adding language\\nunderstanding, the app can use GPT-3 to derive a new answer using the\\ncontent from all of the matching documents. This isn\'t just a verbatim\\nanswer from one document, but a new answer from multiple documents.\\n\\n![Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated](image4.png)\\n\\n## Key Takeaways and Next Steps\\n\\nNow that you\'ve seen a few examples, here are some next steps:\\n\\nSee how Microsoft integrates OpenAI into applications.
