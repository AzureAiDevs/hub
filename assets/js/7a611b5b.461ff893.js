Azure OpenAI Service is now in general availability and offers REST API access to OpenAI\'s models, with features such as security, compliance and regional availability. The large-scale generative AI models developed by OpenAI can be used in areas such as code generation and reasoning over data, while the DALL-E 2 model can create images from a written description. The service also offers the Codex model, which is capable of generating code from natural language.\\n\\n![](image.png)\\n\\nThe goal is to democratise artificial intelligence, as well as using it to help solve global challenges such as climate change, healthcare and education. Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, said: \\"By bringing together OpenAI\'s breakthrough technology with new Azure AI supercomputing technologies, our ambition is to democratise AI, while always keeping AI safety front and centre, so everyone can benefit.\\" To get started with the Azure OpenAI Service, users are advised to learn about OpenAI\'s language models, which include GPT-3, Code and DALL-E 2, and understand key API concepts such as prompts, completions, tokens and models.\\n\\n\\n## Learn More\\n\\nTo learn more, check out this [article](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/fasttrack-for-azure/unleashing-the-power-of-ai-with-azure-openai-a-simple-guide-to/ba-p/3725706).\\n\\n\\n## Questions?\\n\\n[Remember, you can ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/2-unleash-the-power-of-azure-openai)"},{"id":"2023-day3","metadata":{"permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day3","source":"@site/blog/2023-aia/2023-04-04-openai-playground/index.md","title":"3. \ud83c\udfc1Explore the Azure OpenAI Playground","description":"Explore Conversational AI with the Azure OpenAI Service Playground https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day3 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #OpenAI","date":"2023-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 4, 2023","tags":[{"label":"azure-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/azure-ai"},{"label":"azure-open-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/azure-open-ai"},{"label":"30-days-of-azure-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/30-days-of-azure-ai"}],"readingTime":2.52,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Valentina Alto","title":"Data&AI Azure Specialist at Microsoft","url":"https://github.com/Valentina-Alto","tag":"@altovalentina","imageURL":"https://github.com/Valentina-Alto.png","key":"Valentina"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-day3","title":"3. \ud83c\udfc1Explore the Azure OpenAI Playground","authors":["Valentina"],"draft":false,"hide_table_of_contents":false,"toc_min_heading_level":2,"toc_max_heading_level":3,"keywords":["Azure-OpenAI-Services","Azure-AI"],"tags":["azure-ai","azure-open-ai","30-days-of-azure-ai"],"image":"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day3.png","description":"Explore Conversational AI with the Azure OpenAI Service Playground https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day3 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #OpenAI"},"prevItem":{"title":"2. \ud83c\udfc1Unleash the power of Azure OpenAI","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day2"},"nextItem":{"title":"4. \ud83c\udfc1Build an AI Receipt App with Copilot","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day4"}},"content":"<head>\\n\\n  <meta property=\\"og:url\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day3\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:title\\" content=\\"Explore the Azure OpenAI Playground\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:description\\" content=\\"Explore Conversational AI with the Azure OpenAI Service Playground https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day3 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #OpenAI\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:image\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day3.png\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:type\\" content=\\"article\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:site_name\\" content=\\"Azure AI Developer\\" />\\n  \\n\\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://medium.com/microsoftazure/azure-openai-playground-279f1f3da562\\"  />\\n\\n</head>\\n\\n- \ud83d\udce7 [Sign up for the Azure AI Developer Newsletter](https://aka.ms/azure-ai-dev-newsletter)\\n- \ud83d\udcf0 [Subscribe to the #30DaysOfAzureAI RSS feed](https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/rss.xml)\\n- \ud83d\udccc [Ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/3-explore-the-azure-openai-playground)\\n- \ud83d\udca1 [Suggest a topic for a future post](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/call-for-content)\\n\\n## Day _3_ of #30DaysOfAzureAI\\n\\n\x3c!-- README\\nThe following description is also used for the tweet.

It should be an overview of the post that you are referencing.\\nSee the Learn More section, if you supplied a canonical link, then will be displayed here.\\n--\x3e\\n\\n\\n**What\'s Azure OpenAI?**\\n\\nAzure\'s OpenAI Service lets you leverage large scale generative AI\\nmodels based in Azure that have a deep understanding of language and\\ncode as you build new applications. \\"Language understanding\\" means that\\nyou can type or \\"talk\\" to an app to get it do the things you want.\\n\\nIn Azure OpenAI, you can work with these models:\\n\\n-   GPT-3 generates content based on natural language input.\\n\\n-   Codex translates natural language instructions directly into code.\\n\\n-   DALL-E 2 generates realistic images and art from natural language\\n    descriptions.\\n\\nThese models are hosted on Azure, accessible to apps through REST APIs,\\nor through Azure OpenAI Studio for interactive exploration.\\n\\nAzure OpenAI models include built-in content filtering. If inputs or\\ngenerated outputs include inappropriate content, the Azure OpenAI\\nService catches it. Detection and mitigation of harmful use follows the\\nresponsible AI principles, which you can find more about at\\n[aka.ms/AIprinciples](https://aka.ms/AIprinciples).\\n\\nIn this session, we\'ll unpack the core concepts for interacting with\\nmodels, using prompts, and demonstrate how you can use Azure\'s OpenAI\\nStudio to experiment with and test your models before bringing them into\\nyour code to deliver differentiated app experiences, all with Azure\'s\\nenterprise-grade security for your app\'s foundation.\\n\\n## Scenario One: Converse with Minecraft\\n\\nTransforming the surface area of an app might be easier than you think!\\nIn this video segment, Pablo shows us how he used Minecraft\'s extension\\nAPIs to integrate a conversational user interaction model to build in\\nMinecraft.\\n\\nThe add-in module, named \\"conjure\\", collects a text input that\'s passed\\nto Codex, transforming user intent into actionable code that Minecraft\\nunderstands.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3t3qZu1Dy1k?start=341\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\nIf your application supports plug-in or add-on modules, you can attach a\\nmodule that accepts text prompts as inputs, and then pass that input to\\nCodex to interpret the user intent. Codex returns native code that can\\nthen be processed by your application.\\n\\n## Scenario Two: Combine Content Discovery and Language Understanding to Create New Information\\n\\nThe next example combines the content discovery capabilities of Azure\\nCognitive Search with the language understanding of the GPT-3 model.\\n\\nThe premise is an app for a green energy company that helps users find\\nthe latest insights and developments by scanning content over large\\nvolumes of unstructured content from various sources.\\n\\n-   Cognitive Search accepts a user query and returns a set of matching\\n    documents in order of relevance. Instead of returning the results to\\n    the user, it sends them to GPT-3 for more analysis.\\n\\n-   GPT-3 takes the documents and composes better answers and insights\\n    using content from all of them.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3t3qZu1Dy1k?start=576\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\nIn this example, the app calls Azure Cognitive Search to discover\\ntext-based documents related to the user\'s question. This step finds the\\nmatches, ranks the documents, and returns the most relevant candidates.\\n\\n![Graphical user interface Description automatically generated](image3.png)\\n\\nBut sometimes the best answer isn\'t in one document. By adding language\\nunderstanding, the app can use GPT-3 to derive a new answer using the\\ncontent from all of the matching documents. This isn\'t just a verbatim\\nanswer from one document, but a new answer from multiple documents.\\n\\n![Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated](image4.png)\\n\\n## Key Takeaways and Next Steps\\n\\nNow that you\'ve seen a few examples, here are some next steps:\\n\\nSee how Microsoft integrates OpenAI into applications.

The presenters, Bea and Henk, start with an overview of AI and machine learning, explaining that machine learning is a subset of AI that involves creating a model that can learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. They explain that deep learning, a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks, is well-suited to big data.\\n\\nThe presentation then goes on to demonstrate how to create a machine learning model using ONNX and .NET. The presenters use a dataset of Lego figures and explain how to create a model that can predict the color of a Lego figure based on its shape. They use tools like Visual Studio and the ML.NET library to create the model, and then show how to use the ONNX format to export the model for use in a .NET Maui application.\\n\\nThe presentation concludes with a demo of the .NET Maui application, which uses the machine learning model to predict the color of a Lego figure from an image. The presenters explain how the application works and discuss some of the challenges they faced in creating the model and the application. They also emphasize the importance of testing and evaluating machine learning models to ensure their accuracy and reliability. Overall, the presentation provides an accessible introduction to machine learning using ONNX and .NET, and demonstrates how these tools can be used to create practical applications.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h6HWP5jpA5s\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## Learn More\\n\\nTo learn more, check out this [article](https://youtu.be/h6HWP5jpA5s).\\n\\n\\n## Questions?\\n\\n[Remember, you can ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/11-cross-platform-ai-with-onnx-and-.net)"},{"id":"2023-day12","metadata":{"permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day12","source":"@site/blog/2023-aia/2023-04-13-inside-onnx-excel/index.md","title":"12. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbbRun BERT NLP models locally in Excel","description":"Run BERT NLP models locally in Excel with ONNX and JavaScript https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day12 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #ONNX","date":"2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 13, 2023","tags":[{"label":"ai-april","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ai-april"},{"label":"30-days-of-azure-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/30-days-of-azure-ai"},{"label":"app-developers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/app-developers"}],"readingTime":2.96,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Cassie Breviu","title":"Senior Program Manager","url":"https://github.com/cassiebreviu","tag":"@CassieBreviu","imageURL":"https://github.com/cassiebreviu.png","key":"Cassie"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-day12","title":"12. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbbRun BERT NLP models locally in Excel","authors":["Cassie"],"draft":false,"hide_table_of_contents":false,"toc_min_heading_level":2,"toc_max_heading_level":3,"keywords":["onnx","JavaScript","Excel","Azure-AI"],"tags":["ai-april","30-days-of-azure-ai","app-developers"],"image":"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day12.png","description":"Run BERT NLP models locally in Excel with ONNX and JavaScript https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day12 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #ONNX"},"prevItem":{"title":"11. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbbCross-Platform AI with ONNX and .NET","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day11"},"nextItem":{"title":"13. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbbCopilot\'s updated AI model","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day13"}},"content":"<head>\\n\\n  <meta property=\\"og:url\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day12\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:title\\" content=\\"Run BERT NLP models locally in Excel\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:description\\" content=\\"Run BERT NLP models locally in Excel with ONNX and JavaScript https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day12 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #ONNX\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:image\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day12.png\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:type\\" content=\\"article\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:site_name\\" content=\\"Azure AI Developer\\" />\\n  \\n\\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/excel-addin-bert-js.html\\"  />\\n\\n</head>\\n\\n- \ud83d\udce7 [Sign up for the Azure AI Developer Newsletter](https://aka.ms/azure-ai-dev-newsletter)\\n- \ud83d\udcf0 [Subscribe to the #30DaysOfAzureAI RSS feed](https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/rss.xml)\\n- \ud83d\udccc [Ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/12-run-bert-nlp-models-locally-in-excel)\\n- \ud83d\udca1 [Suggest a topic for a future post](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/call-for-content)\\n\\n## Day _12_ of #30DaysOfAzureAI\\n\\n\x3c!-- README\\nThe following description is also used for the tweet.

The use of BERT-JS and ONNX Runtime enables the creation of an Excel add-in that performs natural language processing tasks within a spreadsheet. BERT, a deep learning model developed by Google, is designed to understand the context and meaning of words in text. By using a transformer-based architecture, BERT can analyze entire sentences or paragraphs rather than processing words one by one. The article provides step-by-step instructions and code examples to help readers follow along in building the add-in.\\n\\nThe article emphasizes the importance of responsible AI in building applications that use machine learning models. By using ONNX Runtime, the performance of the BERT-JS model can be optimized, resulting in faster and more efficient processing of natural language tasks. Additionally, the article encourages developers to be mindful of potential biases and ethical considerations when building applications that use machine learning models. By considering responsible AI practices, developers can create applications that are fair, transparent, and trustworthy.\\n\\n![](bert-excel.gif)\\n\\n## Learn More\\n\\nTo learn more, check out this [article](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/excel-addin-bert-js.html).\\n\\n\\n## Questions?\\n\\n[Remember, you can ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/12-run-bert-nlp-models-locally-in-excel)"},{"id":"2023-day13","metadata":{"permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day13","source":"@site/blog/2023-aia/2023-04-14-copilot/index.md","title":"13. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbbCopilot\'s updated AI model","description":"GitHub Copilot Upgraded: Faster, More Accurate, and More Secure Code https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day13 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #Copilot","date":"2023-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 14, 2023","tags":[{"label":"ai-april","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ai-april"},{"label":"30-days-of-azure-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/30-days-of-azure-ai"},{"label":"app-developers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/app-developers"},{"label":"copilot","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/copilot"}],"readingTime":2.665,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Shuyin Zhao","title":"Senior Director Of Product Management","url":"https://github.com/shuyinzjk","tag":"@newmomrules","imageURL":"https://github.com/shuyinzjk.png","key":"Shuyin"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-day13","title":"13. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbbCopilot\'s updated AI model","authors":["Shuyin"],"draft":false,"hide_table_of_contents":false,"toc_min_heading_level":2,"toc_max_heading_level":3,"keywords":["Copilot","vscode","Azure-AI"],"tags":["ai-april","30-days-of-azure-ai","app-developers","copilot"],"image":"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day13.png","description":"GitHub Copilot Upgraded: Faster, More Accurate, and More Secure Code https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day13 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #Copilot"},"prevItem":{"title":"12. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbbRun BERT NLP models locally in Excel","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day12"},"nextItem":{"title":"14. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbbBlazor Apps and Azure OpenAI","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day14"}},"content":"<head>\\n\\n  <meta property=\\"og:url\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day13\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:title\\" content=\\"Copilot\'s updated AI model\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:description\\" content=\\"GitHub Copilot Upgraded: Faster, More Accurate, and More Secure Code https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day13 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #Copilot\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:image\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day13.png\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:type\\" content=\\"article\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:site_name\\" content=\\"Azure AI Developer\\" />\\n  \\n\\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-now-has-a-better-ai-model-and-new-capabilities/\\"  />\\n\\n</head>\\n\\n- \ud83d\udce7 [Sign up for the Azure AI Developer Newsletter](https://aka.ms/azure-ai-dev-newsletter)\\n- \ud83d\udcf0 [Subscribe to the #30DaysOfAzureAI RSS feed](https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/rss.xml)\\n- \ud83d\udccc [Ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/13-copilot\'s-updated-ai-model)\\n- \ud83d\udca1 [Suggest a topic for a future post](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/call-for-content)\\n\\n## Day _13_ of #30DaysOfAzureAI\\n\\n\x3c!-- README\\nThe following description is also used for the tweet.

The article outlines the advantages of training and deploying models in the cloud, which include the ability to handle larger datasets and models and the ability to scale to many more inference requests. The article provides three ways to perform tasks using Azure ML: using the Azure ML CLI, the Python SDK, or the Studio UI. Two GitHub repositories are included to help readers train and deploy models using the Azure ML CLI and the Python SDK.\\n\\nThe article then shows how to run the training code and save the model using the open-source MLflow framework, which allows for easy visualization of metrics and testing of the trained model. The author also includes commands to invoke the trained model on the dev machine for testing purposes. The article uses the Fashion MNIST dataset as an example and recommends testing code on the development machine first to reduce overhead before moving to the cloud.\\n\\n## Learn More\\n\\nTo learn more, check out this [article](https://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/aml-command).\\n\\n\\n## Questions?\\n\\n[Remember, you can ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/16-scaling-model-dev-with-azure-ml)"},{"id":"2023-day17","metadata":{"permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day17","source":"@site/blog/2023-aia/2023-04-18-azureml-pipelines/index.md","title":"17. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cStreamline Model Dev with Azure ML","description":"Streamlining ML Development with Azure ML Components & Pipelines https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day17 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #AzureML","date":"2023-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 18, 2023","tags":[{"label":"ai-april","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ai-april"},{"label":"30-days-of-azure-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/30-days-of-azure-ai"},{"label":"ml-developers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ml-developers"},{"label":"azure-ml","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/azure-ml"},{"label":"data-scientist","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/data-scientist"}],"readingTime":2.9,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Beatriz Stollnitz","title":"Principal Cloud Advocate AiMl","url":"https://github.com/bstollnitz","tag":"@beastollnitz","imageURL":"https://github.com/bstollnitz.png","key":"Bea"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-day17","title":"17. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cStreamline Model Dev with Azure ML","authors":["Bea"],"draft":false,"hide_table_of_contents":false,"toc_min_heading_level":2,"toc_max_heading_level":3,"keywords":["Machine-Learning","Azure-AI"],"tags":["ai-april","30-days-of-azure-ai","ml-developers","azure-ml","data-scientist"],"image":"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day17.png","description":"Streamlining ML Development with Azure ML Components & Pipelines https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day17 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #AzureML"},"prevItem":{"title":"16. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cScaling Model Dev with Azure ML","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day16"},"nextItem":{"title":"18. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cAzure ML Managed Online Endpoints","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day18"}},"content":"<head>\\n\\n  <meta property=\\"og:url\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day17\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:title\\" content=\\"Streamline Model Dev with Azure ML\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:description\\" content=\\"Streamlining ML Development with Azure ML Components & Pipelines https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day17 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #AzureML\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:image\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day17.png\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:type\\" content=\\"article\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:site_name\\" content=\\"Azure AI Developer\\" />\\n  \\n\\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/aml-pipeline/\\"  />\\n\\n</head>\\n\\n- \ud83d\udce7 [Sign up for the Azure AI Developer Newsletter](https://aka.ms/azure-ai-dev-newsletter)\\n- \ud83d\udcf0 [Subscribe to the #30DaysOfAzureAI RSS feed](https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/rss.xml)\\n- \ud83d\udccc [Ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/17-streamline-model-dev-with-azure-ml)\\n- \ud83d\udca1 [Suggest a topic for a future post](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/call-for-content)\\n\\n## Day _17_ of #30DaysOfAzureAI\\n\\n\x3c!-- README\\nThe following description is also used for the tweet.

It explains how to break down training code into components and connect those components into a pipeline. The author provides two GitHub repositories to illustrate how to work with pipelines and components using the CLI and the Python SDK. The article also emphasizes the importance of organizing work into two steps, i.e., a training step and a test step.\\n\\nThe author also discusses creating Azure ML components as reusable pieces of code with inputs and outputs, which can be defined in their Python file. Inputs and outputs are specified as command-line arguments. The author further highlights that components can help maintain separation in the cloud by organizing training code into two steps with distinct logic. Lastly, the article provides an example of a train component specification that shows the names of the input and output in the component YAML specification match the names of the arguments in the code.\\n\\nThe article emphasizes the importance of testing the code frequently to ensure it executes and provides accurate results. It also recommends using the MLflow API because of the great logging support it provides.\\n\\n![](image.png)\\n\\n## Learn More\\n\\nTo learn more, check out this [article](https://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/aml-pipeline/).\\n\\n\\n## Questions?\\n\\n[Remember, you can ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/17-streamline-model-dev-with-azure-ml)"},{"id":"2023-day18","metadata":{"permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day18","source":"@site/blog/2023-aia/2023-04-19-azureml-endpoints/index.md","title":"18. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cAzure ML Managed Online Endpoints","description":"Azure ML Managed Online Endpoints - A Quickstart https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day18 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #AzureML","date":"2023-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 19, 2023","tags":[{"label":"ai-april","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ai-april"},{"label":"30-days-of-azure-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/30-days-of-azure-ai"},{"label":"ml-developers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ml-developers"},{"label":"azure-ml","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/azure-ml"},{"label":"data-scientist","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/data-scientist"}],"readingTime":2.46,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Vlad Iliescu","title":"Head of AI at Strongbytes and Microsoft MVP","url":"https://github.com/vladiliescu","tag":"@vladiliescu","imageURL":"https://github.com/vladiliescu.png","key":"Vlad"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-day18","title":"18. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cAzure ML Managed Online Endpoints","authors":["Vlad"],"draft":false,"hide_table_of_contents":false,"toc_min_heading_level":2,"toc_max_heading_level":3,"keywords":["Machine-Learning","Azure-AI"],"tags":["ai-april","30-days-of-azure-ai","ml-developers","azure-ml","data-scientist"],"image":"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day18.png","description":"Azure ML Managed Online Endpoints - A Quickstart https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day18 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #AzureML"},"prevItem":{"title":"17. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cStreamline Model Dev with Azure ML","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day17"},"nextItem":{"title":"19. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cDebug models w/ Responsible AI","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day19"}},"content":"<head>\\n\\n  <meta property=\\"og:url\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day18\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:title\\" content=\\"Azure ML Managed Online Endpoints\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:description\\" content=\\"Azure ML Managed Online Endpoints - A Quickstart https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day18 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #AzureML\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:image\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day18.png\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:type\\" content=\\"article\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:site_name\\" content=\\"Azure AI Developer\\" />\\n  \\n\\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://vladiliescu.net/aml-managed-endpoints-quickstart/\\"  />\\n\\n</head>\\n\\n- \ud83d\udce7 [Sign up for the Azure AI Developer Newsletter](https://aka.ms/azure-ai-dev-newsletter)\\n- \ud83d\udcf0 [Subscribe to the #30DaysOfAzureAI RSS feed](https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/rss.xml)\\n- \ud83d\udccc [Ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/18-azure-ml-managed-online-endpoints)\\n- \ud83d\udca1 [Suggest a topic for a future post](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/call-for-content)\\n\\n## Day _18_ of #30DaysOfAzureAI\\n\\n\x3c!-- README\\nThe following description is also used for the tweet.

It should be an overview of the post that you are referencing.\\nSee the Learn More section, if you supplied a canonical link, then will be displayed here.\\n--\x3e\\n\\n\\nThe article discusses the benefits of using Azure Machine Learning\'s managed online endpoints and compares them to Azure Container Instances. The author outlines three main reasons why they prefer managed online endpoints: built-in security, native blue/green deployments, and auto-scaling with Azure Monitor.\\n\\nTo deploy a machine learning model using managed online endpoints, the author suggests using Azure CLI and Azure ML CLI v2 tools. The author provides step-by-step instructions for deploying an online endpoint using an inference script that translates API inputs to something the model can handle, invokes the model, and returns formatted results. The inference script must have two methods: init, which loads the model into memory, and run, which is called when someone invokes the API.\\n\\nOverall, the article is a helpful guide for anyone looking to deploy machine learning models using Azure Machine Learning\'s managed online endpoints.\\n\\n## Learn More\\n\\nTo learn more, check out this [article](https://vladiliescu.net/aml-managed-endpoints-quickstart/).\\n\\n\\n## Questions?\\n\\n[Remember, you can ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/18-azure-ml-managed-online-endpoints)"},{"id":"2023-day19","metadata":{"permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day19","source":"@site/blog/2023-aia/2023-04-20-rai-part-1/index.md","title":"19. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cDebug models w/ Responsible AI","description":"Guide to analyzing ML models for Responsible AI issues (Part 1) https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day19 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #AIEthics","date":"2023-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 20, 2023","tags":[{"label":"azure-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/azure-ai"},{"label":"responsible-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/responsible-ai"},{"label":"30-days-of-azure-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/30-days-of-azure-ai"},{"label":"ml-developers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ml-developers"},{"label":"app-developers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/app-developers"},{"label":"machine-learning-debugging-tools","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/machine-learning-debugging-tools"},{"label":"responsible-ai-tools","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/responsible-ai-tools"}],"readingTime":3.45,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Ruth Yakubu","title":"Principal Cloud Advocate","url":"https://github.com/ruyakubu","tag":"@ruthieyakubu","imageURL":"https://github.com/ruyakubu.png","key":"Ruth"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-day19","title":"19. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cDebug models w/ Responsible AI","authors":["Ruth"],"draft":false,"hide_table_of_contents":false,"toc_min_heading_level":2,"toc_max_heading_level":3,"keywords":["Machine-Learning","Azure-AI","rai-privacy-security","rai-fairness","rai-transparency","rai-accountable","rai-inclusion","rai-reliable"],"tags":["azure-ai","responsible-ai","30-days-of-azure-ai","ml-developers","app-developers","machine-learning-debugging-tools","responsible-ai-tools"],"image":"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day19.png","description":"Guide to analyzing ML models for Responsible AI issues (Part 1) https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day19 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #AIEthics"},"prevItem":{"title":"18. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cAzure ML Managed Online Endpoints","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day18"},"nextItem":{"title":"20. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cLearn MLOps for the ML Lifecycle","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day20"}},"content":"<head>\\n\\n  <meta property=\\"og:url\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day19\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:title\\" content=\\"Debug models w/ Responsible AI\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:description\\" content=\\"Guide to analyzing ML models for Responsible AI issues (Part 1) https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day19 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #AIEthics\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:image\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day19.png\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:type\\" content=\\"article\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:site_name\\" content=\\"Azure AI Developer\\" />\\n  \\n\\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-machine-learning-blog/getting-started-with-azure-machine-learning-responsible-ai/ba-p/3746948\\"  />\\n\\n</head>\\n\\n- \ud83d\udce7 [Sign up for the Azure AI Developer Newsletter](https://aka.ms/azure-ai-dev-newsletter)\\n- \ud83d\udcf0 [Subscribe to the #30DaysOfAzureAI RSS feed](https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/rss.xml)\\n- \ud83d\udccc [Ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/19-debug-models-w/-responsible-ai)\\n- \ud83d\udca1 [Suggest a topic for a future post](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/call-for-content)\\n\\n## Day _19_ of #30DaysOfAzureAI\\n\\n\x3c!-- README\\nThe following description is also used for the tweet.

It should be an overview of the post that you are referencing.\\nSee the Learn More section, if you supplied a canonical link, then will be displayed here.\\n--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## What is Responsible AI Dashboard?\\n\\nThe Responsible AI (RAI) Dashboard is a suite of open-source tools that help developers create responsible AI models with features such as model statistics, data explorer, error analysis, model interpretability, counterfactual analysis, and causal inference. The dashboard is built on leading open-source tools such as ErrorAnalysis, InterpretML, Fairlearn, DiCE, and EconML, and it can be accessed through the Azure Machine Learning platform. The RAI components allow developers to troubleshoot and analyze models and make better decisions to produce more responsible AI systems.\\n\\nInterpretML, Fairlearn, DiCE, and EconML are some of the open-source tools that power the RAI dashboard. InterpretML provides data scientists and AI developers access to state-of-the-art glassbox and opaquebox interpretability models, helping them better understand how their models are making predictions. Fairlearn helps identify fairness issues and covers a set of state-of-the-art mitigation algorithms to address them. DiCE outputs counterfactual datapoints that are similar to the input but with different outcomes, helping ML engineers and business decision-makers generate alternative datapoints. EconML helps business decision-makers explore causal relationships between factors and real-world outcomes.\\n\\nThe RAI dashboard is available as part of the Responsible AI Toolbox via open source or in the Azure Machine Learning platform. It allows ML engineers to analyze models and make better decisions to produce more responsible AI systems. The dashboard can be accessed through the Azure Machine Learning platform, eliminating the need to use open-source libraries separately to troubleshoot model performance, reliability, or fairness in disparate code instances. The tutorial walks users through creating an Azure Machine Learning workspace and using RAI components for further analysis and debugging of a model trained on the Diabetes Hospital Readmission dataset.\\n\\n## Learn More\\n\\nTo learn more, check out this [article](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-machine-learning-blog/getting-started-with-azure-machine-learning-responsible-ai/ba-p/3746948).\\n\\n\\n## Questions?\\n\\n[Remember, you can ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/19-debug-models-w/-responsible-ai)"},{"id":"2023-day20","metadata":{"permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day20","source":"@site/blog/2023-aia/2023-04-21-mlops-intro/index.md","title":"20. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cLearn MLOps for the ML Lifecycle","description":"Learn about Azure Machine Learning lifecycle and open source tooling to start building MLOps https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day20 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #AzureMLOps","date":"2023-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 21, 2023","tags":[{"label":"ai-april","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ai-april"},{"label":"30-days-of-azure-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/30-days-of-azure-ai"},{"label":"ml-developers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ml-developers"}],"readingTime":2.105,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Cassie Breviu","title":"Senior Program Manager","url":"https://github.com/cassiebreviu","tag":"@CassieBreviu","imageURL":"https://github.com/cassiebreviu.png","key":"Cassie"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-day20","title":"20. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cLearn MLOps for the ML Lifecycle","authors":["Cassie"],"draft":false,"hide_table_of_contents":false,"toc_min_heading_level":2,"toc_max_heading_level":3,"keywords":["MLOps","Machine-Learning","Azure-AI"],"tags":["ai-april","30-days-of-azure-ai","ml-developers"],"image":"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day20.png","description":"Learn about Azure Machine Learning lifecycle and open source tooling to start building MLOps https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day20 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #AzureMLOps"},"prevItem":{"title":"19. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cDebug models w/ Responsible AI","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day19"},"nextItem":{"title":"21. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udd2cRecap: Azure ML Week\u2728","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day21"}},"content":"<head>\\n\\n  <meta property=\\"og:url\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day20\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:title\\" content=\\"Learn MLOps for the ML Lifecycle\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:description\\" content=\\"Learn about Azure Machine Learning lifecycle and open source tooling to start building MLOps https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day20 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #AzureMLOps\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:image\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day20.png\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:type\\" content=\\"article\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:site_name\\" content=\\"Azure AI Developer\\" />\\n  \\n\\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://learn.microsoft.com/events/ignite-2022/cll99-learn-live-start-machine-learning-lifecycle-with-mlops\\"  />\\n\\n</head>\\n\\n- \ud83d\udce7 [Sign up for the Azure AI Developer Newsletter](https://aka.ms/azure-ai-dev-newsletter)\\n- \ud83d\udcf0 [Subscribe to the #30DaysOfAzureAI RSS feed](https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/rss.xml)\\n- \ud83d\udccc [Ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/20-learn-mlops-for-the-ml-lifecycle)\\n- \ud83d\udca1 [Suggest a topic for a future post](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/call-for-content)\\n\\n## Day _20_ of #30DaysOfAzureAI\\n\\n\x3c!-- README\\nThe following description is also used for the tweet.

It has been developed with a project-based pedagogy to help students learn while building, with a low-stakes quiz before a class to set the intention of the student towards learning a topic. The course covers basic principles of data science, including ethical concepts, data preparation, data visualization, data analysis, real-world use cases of data science, and more. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 10 week cycle. Microsoft suggests forming a study group with friends to go through the content together or taking the course in whole or in part.\\n\\nThe course includes lessons on defining data science, data science ethics, statistics and probability, working with relational and non-relational data, using Python, data preparation, data visualization, machine learning, and deep learning. There are also optional sketchnotes and supplemental videos, and each lesson includes a challenge, supplemental reading, and post-lesson quiz. Microsoft encourages teachers to use this curriculum and would love feedback in the discussion forum. Students can fork the entire repo and complete the exercises on their own, and to further their study, Microsoft recommends Microsoft Learn.\\n\\n## Learn More\\n\\nTo learn more, check out this [article](https://microsoft.github.io/Data-Science-For-Beginners).\\n\\n\\n## Questions?\\n\\n[Remember, you can ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/23-data-science-for-beginners)"},{"id":"2023-day24","metadata":{"permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day24","source":"@site/blog/2023-aia/2023-04-26-ml-ai-workshops/index.md","title":"24. \ud83c\udfedML and AI for beginners","description":"learn about the ML and AI for beginner workshops https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day24 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #MachineLearning","date":"2023-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 26, 2023","tags":[{"label":"ai-april","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ai-april"},{"label":"30-days-of-azure-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/30-days-of-azure-ai"},{"label":"ml-developers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ml-developers"},{"label":"workshop","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/workshop"}],"readingTime":1.5,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriela de Queiroz","title":"Principal Cloud Advocate Mgr","url":"https://github.com/gdequeiroz","tag":"@gdequeiroz","imageURL":"https://github.com/gdequeiroz.png","key":"Gabriela"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-day24","title":"24. \ud83c\udfedML and AI for beginners","authors":["Gabriela"],"draft":false,"hide_table_of_contents":false,"toc_min_heading_level":2,"toc_max_heading_level":3,"keywords":["AI_Beginners"],"tags":["ai-april","30-days-of-azure-ai","ml-developers","workshop"],"image":"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day24.png","description":"learn about the ML and AI for beginner workshops https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day24 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #MachineLearning"},"prevItem":{"title":"23. \ud83c\udfedData Science for beginners","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day23"},"nextItem":{"title":"25. \ud83c\udfedBuild a Patient Registration App","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day25"}},"content":"<head>\\n\\n  <meta property=\\"og:url\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day24\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:title\\" content=\\"ML and AI for beginners\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:description\\" content=\\"learn about the ML and AI for beginner workshops https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day24 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI #MachineLearning\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:image\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day24.png\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:type\\" content=\\"article\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:site_name\\" content=\\"Azure AI Developer\\" />\\n  \\n\\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners\\"  />\\n\\n</head>\\n\\n- \ud83d\udce7 [Sign up for the Azure AI Developer Newsletter](https://aka.ms/azure-ai-dev-newsletter)\\n- \ud83d\udcf0 [Subscribe to the #30DaysOfAzureAI RSS feed](https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/rss.xml)\\n- \ud83d\udccc [Ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/24-ml-and-ai-for-beginners)\\n- \ud83d\udca1 [Suggest a topic for a future post](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/call-for-content)\\n\\n## Day _24_ of #30DaysOfAzureAI\\n\\n\x3c!-- README\\nThe following description is also used for the tweet.

It should be an overview of the post that you are referencing.\\nSee the Learn More section, if you supplied a canonical link, then will be displayed here.\\n--\x3e\\n\\n\\nAre you tired of manually filling out paper-based forms? Do you wish there was a way to automate the process? Look no further than Azure Form Recognizer, a new Cognitive Service that uses machine learning to extract text and table data from form documents. In this workshop, you\'ll learn how to infuse AI technologies into a web-based patient registration system using Azure services such as Azure Static Web apps, Azure Functions, Azure Cognitive Services, Azure Storage, and Azure Cosmos DB.\\n\\nThe goal of the workshop is to improve the patient experience by automating the paper-based patient registration process at a doctor\'s surgery. You\'ll learn how to create a custom Azure Form Recognizer model, integrate it with a web app, and define application roles that map to workshop personas such as surgery admin, nurse, and doctor. By the end of the workshop, you\'ll have a working solution that allows new patients to complete the registration form online, the web app to extract the data, and the surgery admin to verify and add the registration to the doctor\'s surgery system. Say goodbye to manual form filling and hello to the power of AI technologies with Azure Form Recognizer!\\n\\n![](image.png)\\n\\n## Learn More\\n\\nTo learn more, check out this [article](https://newpatiente2e.github.io/docs/).\\n\\n\\n## Questions?\\n\\n[Remember, you can ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/25-build-a-patient-registration-app)"},{"id":"2023-day26","metadata":{"permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day26","source":"@site/blog/2023-aia/2023-04-28-stable-diffusion/index.md","title":"26. \ud83c\udfedStable Diffusion on Azure ML","description":"How to run Stable Diffusion Web UI on Azure ML compute instances https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day26 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI AzureML","date":"2023-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 28, 2023","tags":[{"label":"ai-april","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ai-april"},{"label":"30-days-of-azure-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/30-days-of-azure-ai"},{"label":"azure-ml","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/azure-ml"},{"label":"ml-engineers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ml-engineers"},{"label":"app-developers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/app-developers"},{"label":"workshop","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/workshop"}],"readingTime":2.84,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Vlad Iliescu","title":"Head of AI at Strongbytes and Microsoft MVP","url":"https://github.com/vladiliescu","tag":"@vladiliescu","imageURL":"https://github.com/vladiliescu.png","key":"Vlad"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-day26","title":"26. \ud83c\udfedStable Diffusion on Azure ML","authors":["Vlad"],"draft":false,"hide_table_of_contents":false,"toc_min_heading_level":2,"toc_max_heading_level":3,"keywords":["Machine-Learning","Azure-AI","StableDiffusion"],"tags":["ai-april","30-days-of-azure-ai","azure-ml","ml-engineers","app-developers","workshop"],"image":"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day26.png","description":"How to run Stable Diffusion Web UI on Azure ML compute instances https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day26 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI AzureML"},"prevItem":{"title":"25. \ud83c\udfedBuild a Patient Registration App","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day25"},"nextItem":{"title":"27. \ud83c\udfedEnhance CX with Azure Personalizer","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day27"}},"content":"<head>\\n\\n  <meta property=\\"og:url\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day26\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:title\\" content=\\"Stable Diffusion on Azure ML\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:description\\" content=\\"How to run Stable Diffusion Web UI on Azure ML compute instances https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day26 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI AzureML\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:image\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day26.png\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:type\\" content=\\"article\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:site_name\\" content=\\"Azure AI Developer\\" />\\n  \\n\\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://vladiliescu.net/stable-diffusion-web-ui-on-azure-ml/\\"  />\\n\\n</head>\\n\\n- \ud83d\udce7 [Sign up for the Azure AI Developer Newsletter](https://aka.ms/azure-ai-dev-newsletter)\\n- \ud83d\udcf0 [Subscribe to the #30DaysOfAzureAI RSS feed](https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/rss.xml)\\n- \ud83d\udccc [Ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/26-stable-diffusion-on-azure-ml)\\n- \ud83d\udca1 [Suggest a topic for a future post](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/call-for-content)\\n\\n## Day _26_ of #30DaysOfAzureAI\\n\\n\x3c!-- README\\nThe following description is also used for the tweet.
