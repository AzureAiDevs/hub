It includes components for data analysis, model troubleshooting, fairness evaluation, and causal relationship exploration. To use the RAI Dashboard, a user needs an Azure Machine Learning workspace and can refer to a tutorial using the Diabetes Hospital Readmission dataset. \\n\\n## What We\'ll Cover\\n\\n\\n- The RAI Dashboard is a suite of open-source tools for responsible AI development, including features like model interpretability, error analysis, and counterfactual analysis.\\n- The RAI Dashboard is accessible via the Azure Machine Learning platform.\\n- RAI components help ML engineers and decision-makers improve AI responsibility.\\n\\n\x3c!--\\n- Covered 1\\n- Covered 2\\n- Covered 3\\n --\x3e\\n\\n![Empty Banner Placeholder](banner.png)\\n\\n\\n## What is Responsible AI Dashboard?\\n\\nThe Responsible AI (RAI) Dashboard is a suite of open-source tools that help developers create responsible AI models with features such as model statistics, data explorer, error analysis, model interpretability, counterfactual analysis, and causal inference. The dashboard is built on leading open-source tools such as ErrorAnalysis, InterpretML, Fairlearn, DiCE, and EconML, and it can be accessed through the Azure Machine Learning platform. The RAI components allow developers to troubleshoot and analyze models and make better decisions to produce more responsible AI systems.\\n\\nInterpretML, Fairlearn, DiCE, and EconML are some of the open-source tools that power the RAI dashboard. InterpretML provides data scientists and AI developers access to state-of-the-art glassbox and opaquebox interpretability models, helping them better understand how their models are making predictions. Fairlearn helps identify fairness issues and covers a set of state-of-the-art mitigation algorithms to address them. DiCE outputs counterfactual datapoints that are similar to the input but with different outcomes, helping ML engineers and business decision-makers generate alternative datapoints. EconML helps business decision-makers explore causal relationships between factors and real-world outcomes.\\n\\nThe RAI dashboard is available as part of the Responsible AI Toolbox via open source or in the Azure Machine Learning platform. It allows ML engineers to analyze models and make better decisions to produce more responsible AI systems. The dashboard can be accessed through the Azure Machine Learning platform, eliminating the need to use open-source libraries separately to troubleshoot model performance, reliability, or fairness in disparate code instances. The tutorial walks users through creating an Azure Machine Learning workspace and using RAI components for further analysis and debugging of a model trained on the Diabetes Hospital Readmission dataset.\\n\\n\\n\x3c!-- Content for the day goes here. --\x3e\\n\\n## Learn More\\n\\nTo learn more, check out this [article](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-machine-learning-blog/getting-started-with-azure-machine-learning-responsible-ai/ba-p/3746948).\\n\\n\\n## Questions?\\n\\n[Remember, you can ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/6-debug-models-w/-responsible-ai)"},{"id":"2023-day7","metadata":{"permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day7","source":"@site/blog/2023-aia/2023-04-08-ai-accessibility/index.md","title":"7. \ud83c\udfc1Accessible AI Apps for Everyone","description":"Learn to build AI for everyone with AI for Accessibility","date":"2023-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 8, 2023","tags":[{"label":"ai-april","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ai-april"},{"label":"30-days-of-azure-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/30-days-of-azure-ai"},{"label":"ml-developers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ml-developers"},{"label":"app-developers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/app-developers"},{"label":"ai-for-accessibility","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ai-for-accessibility"}],"readingTime":2.3,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Henk Boelman","title":"Senior Cloud Advocate @hboelman","url":"https://github.com/hnky","imageURL":"https://github.com/hnky.png","key":"Henk"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-day7","title":"7. \ud83c\udfc1Accessible AI Apps for Everyone","authors":["Henk"],"draft":false,"hide_table_of_contents":false,"toc_min_heading_level":2,"toc_max_heading_level":3,"keywords":["Accessibility-Employment","Accessibility-Modern-Life","Accessibility-Human-Connection"],"tags":["ai-april","30-days-of-azure-ai","ml-developers","app-developers","ai-for-accessibility"],"image":"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/og/30-01.png","description":"Learn to build AI for everyone with AI for Accessibility"},"prevItem":{"title":"6. \ud83c\udfc1Debug models w/ Responsible AI","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day6"},"nextItem":{"title":"8. \ud83c\udfc1Recap: Fundamentals Week\u2728","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day8"}},"content":"<head>\\n\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:url\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/ai-april/2023-day7\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:title\\" content=\\"Accessible AI Apps for Everyone\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:description\\" content=\\"Learn to build AI for everyone with AI for Accessibility\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:image\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/og/30-01.png\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:card\\" content=\\"summary_large_image\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:creator\\" content=\\"dglover\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:site\\" content=\\"@AzureAdvocates\\" /> \\n  \\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://www.microsoft.com/ai/ai-for-accessibility\\"  />\\n\\n</head>\\n\\n- \ud83d\udce7 [Subscribe to the Azure AI Developer Newsletter](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/subscribe)\\n- \ud83d\udccc [Ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/7-accessible-ai-apps-for-everyone)\\n- \ud83d\udca1 [Suggest a topic for a future post](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/call-for-content)\\n\\n\x3c!-- \\n\\nPLEASE READ THIS BEFORE EDITING THIS FILE\\n\\n- This file is a template for the daily posts of the #30DaysOf series.\\n\\n- TWITTER IMAGE: \\n  - Create a image suitable for twitter and place it in the same folder as this file. \\n  - The image must be named twitter.png\\n  - The ideal image size is 1600x900 pixels.\\n\\n --\x3e\\n\\n## Day _7_ of #30DaysOfAzureAI\\n\\n**Learn to build AI for everyone with AI for Accessibility**\\n\\nThe article overviews AI projects aimed at improving the lives of people with disabilities, from education to home and low-cost assistive technology.

If inputs or\\ngenerated outputs include inappropriate content, the Azure OpenAI\\nService catches it. Detection and mitigation of harmful use follows the\\nresponsible AI principles, which you can find more about at\\n[aka.ms/AIprinciples](https://aka.ms/AIprinciples).\\n\\nIn this session, we\'ll unpack the core concepts for interacting with\\nmodels, using prompts, and demonstrate how you can use Azure\'s OpenAI\\nStudio to experiment with and test your models before bringing them into\\nyour code to deliver differentiated app experiences, all with Azure\'s\\nenterprise-grade security for your app\'s foundation.\\n\\n## Scenario One: Converse with Minecraft\\n\\nTransforming the surface area of an app might be easier than you think!\\nIn this video segment, Pablo shows us how he used Minecraft\'s extension\\nAPIs to integrate a conversational user interaction model to build in\\nMinecraft.\\n\\nThe add-in module, named \\"conjure\\", collects a text input that\'s passed\\nto Codex, transforming user intent into actionable code that Minecraft\\nunderstands.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3t3qZu1Dy1k?start=341\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\nIf your application supports plug-in or add-on modules, you can attach a\\nmodule that accepts text prompts as inputs, and then pass that input to\\nCodex to interpret the user intent. Codex returns native code that can\\nthen be processed by your application.\\n\\n## Scenario Two: Combine Content Discovery and Language Understanding to Create New Information\\n\\nThe next example combines the content discovery capabilities of Azure\\nCognitive Search with the language understanding of the GPT-3 model.\\n\\nThe premise is an app for a green energy company that helps users find\\nthe latest insights and developments by scanning content over large\\nvolumes of unstructured content from various sources.\\n\\n-   Cognitive Search accepts a user query and returns a set of matching\\n    documents in order of relevance. Instead of returning the results to\\n    the user, it sends them to GPT-3 for more analysis.\\n\\n-   GPT-3 takes the documents and composes better answers and insights\\n    using content from all of them.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3t3qZu1Dy1k?start=576\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\nIn this example, the app calls Azure Cognitive Search to discover\\ntext-based documents related to the user\'s question. This step finds the\\nmatches, ranks the documents, and returns the most relevant candidates.\\n\\n![Graphical user interface Description automatically generated](image3.png)\\n\\nBut sometimes the best answer isn\'t in one document. By adding language\\nunderstanding, the app can use GPT-3 to derive a new answer using the\\ncontent from all of the matching documents. This isn\'t just a verbatim\\nanswer from one document, but a new answer from multiple documents.\\n\\n![Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated](image4.png)\\n\\n## Key Takeaways and Next Steps\\n\\nNow that you\'ve seen a few examples, here are some next steps:\\n\\nSee how Microsoft integrates OpenAI into applications.

YouTube\\" features a presentation by two cloud advocates from Microsoft, Beatriz Stollnitz and Henk Boelman, who demonstrate how to create a machine learning model using ONNX and .NET. The presentation includes a brief introduction to artificial intelligence (AI) and its subsets, with a focus on machine learning and deep learning. The presenters also explain the difference between traditional programming and machine learning, and how the latter can be used to solve problems that are difficult to solve using traditional programming.\\n\\n## What We\'ll Cover\\n\\n\\n1. The presentation is about machine learning models with ONNX and .NET, presented by Beatriz Stollnitz and Henk.\\n2. They start with a dataset of Lego figures, create a model, and demonstrate how to run it in a .NET Maui application that can run on a mobile phone.\\n3. The presentation covers an overview of AI, machine learning, expert systems, and deep learning, and how they relate to traditional programming.\\n\\n\x3c!--\\n- Covered 1\\n- Covered 2\\n- Covered 3\\n --\x3e\\n\\n![Empty Banner Placeholder](banner.png)\\n\\n\\nThe video is a presentation on machine learning models using ONNX and .NET. The presenters, Bea and Henk, start with an overview of AI and machine learning, explaining that machine learning is a subset of AI that involves creating a model that can learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. They explain that deep learning, a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks, is well-suited to big data.\\n\\nThe presentation then goes on to demonstrate how to create a machine learning model using ONNX and .NET. The presenters use a dataset of Lego figures and explain how to create a model that can predict the color of a Lego figure based on its shape. They use tools like Visual Studio and the ML.NET library to create the model, and then show how to use the ONNX format to export the model for use in a .NET Maui application.\\n\\nThe presentation concludes with a demo of the .NET Maui application, which uses the machine learning model to predict the color of a Lego figure from an image. The presenters explain how the application works and discuss some of the challenges they faced in creating the model and the application. They also emphasize the importance of testing and evaluating machine learning models to ensure their accuracy and reliability. Overall, the presentation provides an accessible introduction to machine learning using ONNX and .NET, and demonstrates how these tools can be used to create practical applications.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h6HWP5jpA5s\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\x3c!-- Content for the day goes here. --\x3e\\n\\n## Learn More\\n\\n\\n\\n## Questions?\\n\\n[Remember, you can ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/11-cross-platform-ai-with-onnx-and-.net)"},{"id":"2023-day12","metadata":{"permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day12","source":"@site/blog/2023-aia/2023-04-13-inside-onnx-excel/index.md","title":"12. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbbImplement BERT NLP models in Excel","description":"ONNX Runtime Custom Excel Functions for BERT NLP Tasks in JavaScript","date":"2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 13, 2023","tags":[{"label":"ai-april","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ai-april"},{"label":"30-days-of-azure-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/30-days-of-azure-ai"},{"label":"app-developers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/app-developers"}],"readingTime":3.07,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Cassie Breviu","title":"Senior Program Manager @CassieBreviu","url":"https://github.com/cassiebreviu","imageURL":"https://github.com/cassiebreviu.png","key":"Cassie"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-day12","title":"12. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbbImplement BERT NLP models in Excel","authors":["Cassie"],"draft":false,"hide_table_of_contents":false,"toc_min_heading_level":2,"toc_max_heading_level":3,"keywords":["onnx","JavaScript","Excel","Azure-AI"],"tags":["ai-april","30-days-of-azure-ai","app-developers"],"image":"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/og/30-01.png","description":"ONNX Runtime Custom Excel Functions for BERT NLP Tasks in JavaScript"},"prevItem":{"title":"11. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbbCross-Platform AI with ONNX and .NET","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day11"},"nextItem":{"title":"13. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbbCopilot\'s updated AI model","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day13"}},"content":"<head>\\n\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:url\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/ai-april/2023-day12\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:title\\" content=\\"Implement BERT NLP models in Excel\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:description\\" content=\\"ONNX Runtime Custom Excel Functions for BERT NLP Tasks in JavaScript\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:image\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/og/30-01.png\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:card\\" content=\\"summary_large_image\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:creator\\" content=\\"dglover\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:site\\" content=\\"@AzureAdvocates\\" /> \\n  \\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/excel-addin-bert-js.html\\"  />\\n\\n</head>\\n\\n- \ud83d\udce7 [Subscribe to the Azure AI Developer Newsletter](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/subscribe)\\n- \ud83d\udccc [Ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/12-implement-bert-nlp-models-in-excel)\\n- \ud83d\udca1 [Suggest a topic for a future post](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/call-for-content)\\n\\n\x3c!-- \\n\\nPLEASE READ THIS BEFORE EDITING THIS FILE\\n\\n- This file is a template for the daily posts of the #30DaysOf series.\\n\\n- TWITTER IMAGE: \\n  - Create a image suitable for twitter and place it in the same folder as this file. \\n  - The image must be named twitter.png\\n  - The ideal image size is 1600x900 pixels.\\n\\n --\x3e\\n\\n## Day _12_ of #30DaysOfAzureAI\\n\\n**ONNX Runtime Custom Excel Functions for BERT NLP Tasks in JavaScript**\\n\\nThe article \\"Building an Excel Add-in with BERT-JS and ONNX Runtime\\" provides readers with a guide to creating an Excel add-in that can perform natural language processing tasks using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and ONNX Runtime.

They describe ML Ops as a solution to the problems that arise when working with machine learning, such as the need for standard repeatable processes, cross-team alignments, large amounts of resources, and the ability to audit and explain. They also introduce the Microsoft Learn platform, which provides free resources for learning about various technologies, including ML Ops. The video covers identifying the different steps of the ML lifecycle, creating and managing machine learning models with ML Ops, and monitoring models and responding to incidents. Throughout the session, the experts encourage viewers to ask questions and interact with the moderators in the chat.\\n\\n## What We\'ll Cover\\n\\n\\nThe three main points covered are:\\n1.

You\'ll learn how to create a custom Azure Form Recognizer model, integrate it with a web app, and define application roles that map to workshop personas such as surgery admin, nurse, and doctor. By the end of the workshop, you\'ll have a working solution that allows new patients to complete the registration form online, the web app to extract the data, and the surgery admin to verify and add the registration to the doctor\'s surgery system. Say goodbye to manual form filling and hello to the power of AI technologies with Azure Form Recognizer!\\n\\n![](image.png)\\n\\n\x3c!-- Content for the day goes here. --\x3e\\n\\n## Learn More\\n\\nTo learn more, check out this [article](https://newpatiente2e.github.io/docs/).\\n\\n\\n## Questions?\\n\\n[Remember, you can ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/25-build-a-patient-registration-app)"},{"id":"2023-day26","metadata":{"permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day26","source":"@site/blog/2023-aia/2023-04-28-stable-diffusion/index.md","title":"26. \ud83c\udfedStable Diffusion on Azure ML","description":"How to run Stable Diffusion Web UI on Azure ML compute instances","date":"2023-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 28, 2023","tags":[{"label":"ai-april","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ai-april"},{"label":"30-days-of-azure-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/30-days-of-azure-ai"},{"label":"azure-ml","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/azure-ml"},{"label":"ml-engineers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ml-engineers"},{"label":"app-developers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/app-developers"},{"label":"workshop","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/workshop"}],"readingTime":2.29,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Vlad Iliescu","title":"Head of AI at Strongbytes and Microsoft MVP @vladiliescu","url":"https://github.com/vladiliescu","imageURL":"https://github.com/vladiliescu.png","key":"Vlad"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-day26","title":"26. \ud83c\udfedStable Diffusion on Azure ML","authors":["Vlad"],"draft":false,"hide_table_of_contents":false,"toc_min_heading_level":2,"toc_max_heading_level":3,"keywords":["Machine-Learning","Azure-AI","StableDiffusion"],"tags":["ai-april","30-days-of-azure-ai","azure-ml","ml-engineers","app-developers","workshop"],"image":"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/og/30-01.png","description":"How to run Stable Diffusion Web UI on Azure ML compute instances"},"prevItem":{"title":"25. \ud83c\udfedBuild a Patient Registration App","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day25"},"nextItem":{"title":"27. \ud83c\udfedEngage with Azure Personalizer","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day27"}},"content":"<head>\\n\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:url\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/ai-april/2023-day26\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:title\\" content=\\"Stable Diffusion on Azure ML\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:description\\" content=\\"How to run Stable Diffusion Web UI on Azure ML compute instances\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:image\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/og/30-01.png\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:card\\" content=\\"summary_large_image\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:creator\\" content=\\"dglover\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:site\\" content=\\"@AzureAdvocates\\" /> \\n  \\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://vladiliescu.net/stable-diffusion-web-ui-on-azure-ml/\\"  />\\n\\n</head>\\n\\n- \ud83d\udce7 [Subscribe to the Azure AI Developer Newsletter](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/subscribe)\\n- \ud83d\udccc [Ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/26-stable-diffusion-on-azure-ml)\\n- \ud83d\udca1 [Suggest a topic for a future post](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/call-for-content)\\n\\n\x3c!-- \\n\\nPLEASE READ THIS BEFORE EDITING THIS FILE\\n\\n- This file is a template for the daily posts of the #30DaysOf series.\\n\\n- TWITTER IMAGE: \\n  - Create a image suitable for twitter and place it in the same folder as this file. \\n  - The image must be named twitter.png\\n  - The ideal image size is 1600x900 pixels.\\n\\n --\x3e\\n\\n## Day _26_ of #30DaysOfAzureAI\\n\\n**How to run Stable Diffusion Web UI on Azure ML compute instances**\\n\\n\\"Unlock the full potential of Stable Diffusion with Azure Machine Learning.
