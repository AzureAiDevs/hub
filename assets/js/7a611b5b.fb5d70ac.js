If inputs or\\ngenerated outputs include inappropriate content, the Azure OpenAI\\nService catches it. Detection and mitigation of harmful use follows the\\nresponsible AI principles, which you can find more about at\\n[aka.ms/AIprinciples](https://aka.ms/AIprinciples).\\n\\nIn this session, we\'ll unpack the core concepts for interacting with\\nmodels, using prompts, and demonstrate how you can use Azure\'s OpenAI\\nStudio to experiment with and test your models before bringing them into\\nyour code to deliver differentiated app experiences, all with Azure\'s\\nenterprise-grade security for your app\'s foundation.\\n\\n## Scenario One: Converse with Minecraft\\n\\nTransforming the surface area of an app might be easier than you think!\\nIn this video segment, Pablo shows us how he used Minecraft\'s extension\\nAPIs to integrate a conversational user interaction model to build in\\nMinecraft.\\n\\nThe add-in module, named \\"conjure\\", collects a text input that\'s passed\\nto Codex, transforming user intent into actionable code that Minecraft\\nunderstands.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3t3qZu1Dy1k?start=341\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\nIf your application supports plug-in or add-on modules, you can attach a\\nmodule that accepts text prompts as inputs, and then pass that input to\\nCodex to interpret the user intent. Codex returns native code that can\\nthen be processed by your application.\\n\\n## Scenario Two: Combine Content Discovery and Language Understanding to Create New Information\\n\\nThe next example combines the content discovery capabilities of Azure\\nCognitive Search with the language understanding of the GPT-3 model.\\n\\nThe premise is an app for a green energy company that helps users find\\nthe latest insights and developments by scanning content over large\\nvolumes of unstructured content from various sources.\\n\\n-   Cognitive Search accepts a user query and returns a set of matching\\n    documents in order of relevance. Instead of returning the results to\\n    the user, it sends them to GPT-3 for more analysis.\\n\\n-   GPT-3 takes the documents and composes better answers and insights\\n    using content from all of them.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3t3qZu1Dy1k?start=576\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\nIn this example, the app calls Azure Cognitive Search to discover\\ntext-based documents related to the user\'s question. This step finds the\\nmatches, ranks the documents, and returns the most relevant candidates.\\n\\n![Graphical user interface Description automatically generated](image3.png)\\n\\nBut sometimes the best answer isn\'t in one document. By adding language\\nunderstanding, the app can use GPT-3 to derive a new answer using the\\ncontent from all of the matching documents. This isn\'t just a verbatim\\nanswer from one document, but a new answer from multiple documents.\\n\\n![Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated](image4.png)\\n\\n## Key Takeaways and Next Steps\\n\\nNow that you\'ve seen a few examples, here are some next steps:\\n\\nSee how Microsoft integrates OpenAI into applications.

The lab is designed to help you learn how to use Azure Form Recognizer to automate the patient registration process at a doctor\'s surgery. You\'ll learn how to create a custom Azure Form Recognizer model, integrate it with a web app, and define application roles that map to workshop personas such as surgery admin, nurse, and doctor. By the end of the workshop, you\'ll have a working solution that allows new patients to complete the registration form online, the web app to extract the data, and the surgery admin to verify and add the registration to the doctor\'s surgery system. Say goodbye to manual form filling and hello to the power of AI technologies with Azure Form Recognizer!\\n\\n![](image.png)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc53 Read today\'s article\\n\\nToday\'s [article](https://newpatiente2e.github.io/docs/).\\n\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Questions?\\n\\n[Remember, you can ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/Discussions/discussions/categories/25-build-a-patient-registration-app)"},{"id":"2023-day26","metadata":{"permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day26","source":"@site/blog/2023-aia/2023-04-28-stable-diffusion/index.md","title":"26. \ud83c\udfedStable Diffusion on Azure ML","description":"How to run Stable Diffusion Web UI on Azure ML compute instances https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day26 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI AzureML","date":"2023-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 28, 2023","tags":[{"label":"ai-april","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ai-april"},{"label":"30-days-of-azure-ai","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/30-days-of-azure-ai"},{"label":"azure-ml","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/azure-ml"},{"label":"ml-engineers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/ml-engineers"},{"label":"app-developers","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/app-developers"},{"label":"workshop","permalink":"/hub/blog/tags/workshop"}],"readingTime":2.465,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Vlad Iliescu","title":"Head of AI at Strongbytes and Microsoft MVP","url":"https://github.com/vladiliescu","tag":"@vladiliescu","imageURL":"https://github.com/vladiliescu.png","key":"Vlad"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-day26","title":"26. \ud83c\udfedStable Diffusion on Azure ML","authors":["Vlad"],"draft":false,"hide_table_of_contents":false,"toc_min_heading_level":2,"toc_max_heading_level":3,"keywords":["Machine-Learning","Azure-AI","StableDiffusion"],"tags":["ai-april","30-days-of-azure-ai","azure-ml","ml-engineers","app-developers","workshop"],"image":"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day26.png","description":"How to run Stable Diffusion Web UI on Azure ML compute instances https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day26 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI AzureML"},"prevItem":{"title":"25. \ud83c\udfedBuild a Patient Registration App","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day25"},"nextItem":{"title":"27. \ud83c\udfedEnhance CX with Azure Personalizer","permalink":"/hub/blog/2023-day27"}},"content":"<head>\\n\\n  <meta property=\\"og:url\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day26\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:title\\" content=\\"Stable Diffusion on Azure ML\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:description\\" content=\\"How to run Stable Diffusion Web UI on Azure ML compute instances https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/2023-day26 #30DaysOfAzureAI #AzureAiDevs #AI AzureML\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:image\\" content=\\"https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/img/2023/banner-day26.png\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:type\\" content=\\"article\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:site_name\\" content=\\"Azure AI Developer\\" />\\n  \\n\\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://vladiliescu.net/stable-diffusion-web-ui-on-azure-ml/\\"  />\\n\\n</head>\\n\\n- \ud83d\udce7 [Sign up for the Azure AI Developer Newsletter](https://aka.ms/azure-ai-dev-newsletter)\\n- \ud83d\udcf0 [Subscribe to the #30DaysOfAzureAI RSS feed](https://azureaidevs.github.io/hub/blog/rss.xml)\\n- \ud83d\udccc [Ask a question about this post on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/26-stable-diffusion-on-azure-ml)\\n- \ud83d\udca1 [Suggest a topic for a future post](https://github.com/AzureAiDevs/hub/discussions/categories/call-for-content)\\n\\n## \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f Day _26_ of #30DaysOfAzureAI\\n\\n\x3c!-- README\\nThe following description is also used for the tweet.
